The Beast of Sarsmouth
Divyansh Prakash

I. Prologue
I was sure I had heard a footstep. I stood still, facing the direction the noise had come from. The darkness was blinding, impenetrable, and no man could ever get used to it without jeopardising his sanity. The hair on my body stood up, and a chilling sensation percolated slowly into my bones, as I strained my senses for the faintest hint of bearing. Even after all these years, I could not believe what it was that fate had in store for me.

II. Hindsight
It had been the month of June of the ninth year, and the village folk had begun to sing of the great legend that I had been raised to be a part of. I was the eldest son, with my first uncle's son Jared just a month younger to me. One could hear the cheers of the villagers wherever I went, and I had grown to ignore this irritable routine after the first three days.
I remember the rush of primal energy that gave me enough strength to practice my swordsmanship for as much as twenty hours a day. The looks on the faces of the men around me were reason enough. Ever since the day I was born, I had been looked upon as a Messiah, a tool to rid the village of its misery. I had grown up listening to the story of my forefathers, and had shone in their glory, awaiting my turn.
It had been a dark winter night, the night that I turned five, that Frida had first told me of the family legacy. She had been standing by the large window when the long, deep moan had excited the dry cold air, and had made even the strongest of men shiver. The deep growl was heard even two miles away, and had been heard every year on the anniversary of my birth. "That is the Beast of the Cave", Frida had said, pulling the curtains over the windows, "and one day, you will kill it." "Me?" I had asked, a wave of excitement spreading over my body, for fear did not have a place in the hearts that pumped the blood of my family, and Frida then told me the story that I can clearly recall even to this day-
Many centuries ago, the body of a child from the village of Sarsmouth had been found near the mouth of the large cave that opened near the Sardis river, by the southern edge of the forest. His head had been pulled apart from the rest of the body with such force, that a part of his spine had come off with it. Three more skeletons of human children were found scattered around the place, and all three of them had met the same horrible fate. The villagers had been terrified, and had come to their Liege and Master, my great ancestor Graham, for help. The elders had soon realized that all four children had mysteriously disappeared at somewhat regular intervals of about ten twelvemonths each.
Being the noble and honourable man he was, my ancestor had decided that he would go into the cave, and slay the horrible beast that had so terrorized the village. "If I do not return," he had dictated, "I will the eldest man with my blood in his veins to follow my lead after ten full years. For if I do not return, whatever obscenity dwells in that cave shall rest with its blood-lust satiated for that interval. I forbid other men to venture into the earthen recesses of the cave, and I will that I or a man of my blood either slay the monster, or fall prey to it, and let no other man suffer." Thus, after a year of preparation, he had ventured into the cave, proud and alone, on the sixteenth day of July.
Thirteen generations had passed since, with the eldest man in the extended family going into the cave, never to return, while the monstrosity still occupied the huge cave by the river, though it lay dormant, feeding only on the men of my blood. The last one, I have been told, had been my father. And he too like the twelve before him had never returned, making me an heir to this horrible destiny.
Here, I believe I owe you a small but important piece of information, else you might judge my great ancestor's unfortunate decisions too harshly. It was he who had first found Sarsmouth at the young age of eighteen. He had also discovered a way to make the soil potent and the water potable. The men who had followed him here had held him in such high esteem that would have made even the mighty gods burn with envy. I can say with much pride and equal regret, that this was true even to the present day. Nothing in the village happened without our approval, and much care was taken to not to cause us even the slightest discomfort. I had vowed, and now know, that I could do anything to protect the honour and pride that the name of my family had given to me in heritage. Anything at all.
Twelve months had passed since my preparations first began, and it was now the June of the tenth year. The carnival was in full flow, as everyone waited for the ritual that took place once a decade in the village of Sarsmouth; the ritual which would either earn me more fear and respect than the great Ulthar, or devoid my family of yet another man. I had not even been married, for I was too young. Jared would have to continue the lineage after me. I pondered on these thoughts, like many others, and seldom talked to anyone but my cousin. Jared was the only one person who knew how I felt, for he had always lived in fear of my untimely death. He was always with me, and had always stood by me, if only for his own good. We lived on, brothers more by fear than by blood, though we strived to hide this fact from the others.
The flames on the villagers' torches danced around in the cold wind. The moonless night reflected the void inside me. With one last glance at Jared who gave a slight nod, I started walking slowly up the Sardis, for it was the sixteenth day of July of the tenth year. I was clad in iron from head to toe, and held a longsword in my hands. My grasp on the ruby-studded hilt grew tighter as the insatiable mouth of the legendary cave grew in the distance. I struggled not to look back, for that would only remind me how lonely I was. I imagined an army walking behind me, and led the silent shadows of these imaginary men into war.
I lit my torch from the splinters I had with me, when the mouth of the cave was but five feet away. With one long, deep breath, I stepped into the sprawling abyss. The cave was so high, that the roof was not visible, even in the flame of the torch. I took small steps forward, my eyes finding even a lone spider to be a murderous ghoul. My feet slipped on the excretra of bats, and other horrible creatures that live in the dark. After what seemed to me an hour, which could have been anything from a quarter-hour to a half-day, I found myself to be helplessly lost. I could devise not the direction I had come from, and this made me more uncomfortable than what lay beyond. Walking cautiously along the path that seemed to me the most feasible, that was the first time I really felt any fear of my surroundings, for in front of me, by the near wall of the cave, lay a human skeleton. I flinched at the sight, more in fear than in disgust; for it surely belonged to someone I shared my blood with.
As my eyes grew accustomed to the sight before me, I noticed, for the first time, many more human bones lying around on the ground. They had probably been fed off. My senses grew in accuracy, and I was now aware of every small change in the darkness around me. It was at that moment that I first heard the noise. It was unmistakably the drum of one bone against another. Something near me was alive, and it had killed my father. I dropped the torch to the ground, grabbing the sword again with both my hands. I moved slowly towards the direction the sound had come from, the darkness engulfing me slowly as I moved on.
Just then, something leapt at me from the nothingness. It was leathery and covered with hair, and was surely larger than I was. I swung my sword around, but missed it completely, slicing only the damp shadows. Darkness stared at me from all directions, and I cannot forget the fear that shook me to the very core of my being. In that moment, I was overcome by such madness, mostly due to my horror, and partly for my hatred against this being that had killed so many of mine blood, that I started to yell. I yelled unintelligibly, swinging my sword from side to side, and in all directions I could. I moved around in circles, swinging furiously, with all the might I had. In my rage, I found out later, I had come very close to one of the many dead-ends of the cave where pieces of metal lay about on the floor. My sword, without my intending to, hit living flesh with a sickening thud. The moment brought to me not the relief or feeling of triumph that I had expected, but rather a feeling of horror and confusion, the likes of which not many men have savoured and lived, for I was sure I had heard a sob. I had no doubt in my mind that I had hit a man.
Leaving the sword buried in the man's flesh, I turned in the opposite direction, and started running with all the energy I had left. I ran blindly for some time, until I saw a faint glow of light coming from the distance. Assuming it to be the mouth of the accursed cave, my portal to the outside world, I ran towards it with all my might. A feeling of utter disappointment came over me when I realised that the glow of light I had thought to be coming from the mouth of the cave actually belonged to the torch I had dropped sometime back. Still, I hurried towards it, getting enormous comfort from the warmth and light it provided.
After picking up the torch, I felt a strange urge to go back and take a look at the monster I had killed. That it had been a man, my mind could still not believe. I tried retracing my steps the best I could, and passed many smaller tunnels from whence I could see many small eyes of the horrendous bats glaring at me. When I finally found my feet striking rusting metal, I knew I had reached the correct place. The sight before me was so gruesome, that I have strived to get it out of the depths of my memory ever since. There lay, by the far end of the small inside cave, a man with a sword buried deep below his left lung. I now saw that luck had played a large part in his death. He had been cornered against the low wall, his feet stuck in the pile of metal that lay on the earthen floor. He had long hair, both on his head and on his face, and his skin was deathly pale. Clearly, it had been a very long time since he had last seen the light of day. Even more unsettling was the sight of carefully positioned cuts on his arms and legs.
But I was still confused. Was this strange man responsible for the death of my ancestors? Why hadn't someone killed him before me, when I was surely not the best swordsman that had taken birth in my family? I moved closer to study the face of the man more carefully. The hairs on his cheek were wet, and I remembered the sob I had heard just before my sword hit him. A strange feeling told me that he had not intended to harm me at all; that it had been more than luck that had enabled me to kill him. It was then that I first saw the engravings on the wall of the cave, a little more than five feet away from the place the man lay dead.
By now, my fear had been totally overcome by a strong urge of curiosity, and I could not wait to see what I now know was my undoing. There, on the low wall of the cave, was engraved a strange story told through pictures; the story of how a man had found the perfect place for his people to live, but soon discovered that the water had too much acid, and had ruined the soil. In his quest to find a way out, he had come to a huge cave, where he had meditated for four long nights. Troubled and hassled by the knowledge that his men would disown him if he didn't find a solution soon, he was slowly slipping into madness. It was then that he saw... he saw something so horrible that I dare not put it down in words. It was probably just a hallucination brought on by his decaying mind, but it rattled him to the very core. He started performing blood rituals and sacrificed humans, and worshipped Gods that should not be spoken of, but it all seemed justified, for the villagers soon found a lake some thousand feet away. Canals were dug, and Sarsmouth prospered.
But it was before long that the villagers noticed how four of their children had disappeared mysteriously over four decades. They had begun to suspect and fear the ancient cave, and were anxious to find and kill whatever had harmed their blood. It was then that the man, now ageing, devised a plan to save his name and that of his family. From that point onward, I knew the story well, and I wanted to burn all that my eyes saw, but I could not take it much longer. My head had started to spin, and my sight faded slowly as I fell to the ground.

III. Epilogue
I was sure I had heard a footstep. I stood still, facing the direction the noise had come from. The darkness was blinding, impenetrable, and no man could ever get used to it without jeopardising his sanity. The hair on my body stood up, and a chilling sensation percolated slowly into my bones, as I strained my senses for the faintest hint of bearing. Even after all these years, I could not believe what it was that fate had in store for me.
Ten years had passed since I had first entered the damned cave, and I had stayed true to my ancestors' footsteps. I had spent my years worshipping the Old Ones with mine own blood and feeding on the creatures that wandered the earthen void, while the rest of my family lived on in dignity and respect. But today... today I would be rewarded for what I had endured for so long. Today, I would be freed of my responsibility towards my blood, and pass it on to my cousin, if he still lived, or to his son; much like I had done for my own father. Today, I would take my last breath as the wretched Beast of Sarsmouth.

Once you are in control go forward and you will find some electric fences
which you cannot cross . Your main objective now is to find the power
source and shut it down so you can cross safely.

Head a little right to the fence and you will see a door , enter it and
blake see's a newly lit flair, which means that someone was just here,
continue down the path and there will be a locked door to the right,
continue some more and you will see a junction box with the door closeby.
Fix the box and the door opens.

Inside the room you will find a man named carter and another cutscene ,
he doenst trust you and to increase the trust you need to heal him, search
in this room until you find the first aid kit and some ammo and other items ,
you will also see a coded door, a PC and a tv monitor called CCTV
( camera controlled TV). Go back to carter and heal him, he still doenst trust
you enough to take orders, now you should give him some weapons and he will
become your friend. Head over to the broken junction box in the room and have
him fix it. Once its done the PC and the CCTV and the savegame spot will be
activated.

Once done you can also go and check the room on the corner which is blocked
by the fuel drums, blow them and put out the fire with the extinguisher. Enter
this room and you will find MP5 ammo and a blowtorch and its ammo. Now go back
to the main room and use the pc for some info and save the game , then use the
CCTV and you will take control of a camera in some other room. With the camera
you can move around with the mouse and zoom in and out witht the forward and
backward movement buttons.

With the camera you can spot the original place where the thing was thawed from,
and also you will see a NPC standing in the corner and a dead body, search and
you will find a white board which had a code on it. Zoom in it untile
blake says something like " what do we have here ".

Now you have the code so go to the coded door and it will open, another cutscene
introduces you to that NPC , his name is cruz and he will tell you something about
the alpha's . Now search the dead body and you will get a key, and there is also
the power switch in this area. Turn the power off. Now access the squad menu and
select the follow all command if you want cruz to follow you. Give him a weapon
and were done here.

Now head back to the hall where you found the burning flare and you will see the
first monsters, these are the scuttlers and they are really really fast, use the
pistol to kill them easily, blow the fuel drum to make it easier for you. When the
area is cleared open the previously locked door. (remember the key of the corpse )
inside the room you will find some pistol ammo and grenades. Head back outside and
to the open . Dont go to the right side yet, instead go to the left along with the
base boundry and you will find a corpse with some ammo and an MP5 and a health pack.

Now head all the way back to the area with the electric fence and now you will be
able to pass. Do so .

As the level starts follow the lights to a radio shack , with an antenna at the top,
head inside and a scuttler will break a box , kill it and search the room for items,
theres a savegame slot there too.

Now get out of here and go to the area front of the radio shacks door, you will find
another small cabin , here you could be attacked , get rid of the scuttlers and head
inside , after extinguishing the flames you will find a flamethrower and some ammo.
( If you didnt notice before then know this that the little blue bar is the cold
meter, once it gets empty then you start losing health, so head indoors whenever
it gets low )

Now head back to the shack and save if you wish, then continue to the area in
the left hand side of the shack door, you will come across a building but the
door wont open, check the area in the left hand side of the door, you will see
some crates , destroy them with ammo or a grenade and you will see a junction
box. Have it repaired and the door will open. Inside you will see another cutscene
in which another member of Alpha Pierce will be introduced, he thinks that your
one of the things and the only way to get his trust is to do a blood test in front
of him. He tells you that there is a medical kit near the kennel and now that
is our objective.

There are some flamethrower canisters in this room, and also a save game spot,
save the game if you wish and leave this place. But before leaving the place
dont forget to take the kennel key off the table to the right hand side of 
pierce, i forgot to mention this before. TAKE THE KEY . Now there is only 1 direction
left to explore and thats where were going. Its the area from the back side of
the radio shack door. That area is filled with scuttlers so you need to be on
your guard at all times, and keep an eye out for your teammates.

There are alot of itmes also scattered in the kennel area, i wont mention them
here but there are a few health packs and a junction box that needs to be fixed.
When your all done head to the back area of the kennel and you will see a ramp
with a door on the top, inside this small building you will find the blood test
hyps's . DONT use them yet, instead head back to pierce.

When you reach him the testing begins, blake tried it on himself first and our
hero is OK. But the other NPC's are both infected and they will turn into the
things right in front of you. Now use the guns to turn their healths to red and
then the flame thrower to finish them. When it is under control head outside
the building and the level ends.

In the opening cutscene of this level you will see that pierce is no longer with
you, and after some explosive moments :-) you will be introduced to pace, he will
tell blake some things. When you are in control grab all the ammo you can see in
thie room and distribute with pace, and dont forget the flash light.

Head out the tower and follow the lights to the next one, here you will see another
box and while it is being fixed some scuttlers will attack, kill them and enter the
building, and you will see a little cutscene , you need to enter that room now.
but you cant ! .

Now enter the room with the snooker table in the middle and you will face some
scuttlers, there is a body there that will spit some out be careful. When all
is done go to the next room and there is a junction box needing some fixing,
pick up the flame grenades aswell and when the box is fixed the door on the
other side will be accessable.

You are now in the cafe here you see anoter PC for some story and if you go to
the back side you will see another NPC, this is williams he wont trust you until
you get rid of the three walkers roaming the area. If you dont know what a walker
is then you will soon find out. In the back area of the kitchen there is a
flamethrower (very important) and some canisters in the cabinet on the wall aswell
as a savegame spot and a few scuttlers.

Go back to the entrance door of the cafe and a walker will come out of the wall in
the other side, first make him weak and red by hitting him with regular guns, and
when he is red then charge in with the flamethrower, but watch out, as the flame
can also affect you and your NPC. Once the first walker is dead head to the hole
in the wall where it came from.

In that room you will see some scuttlers and another walker will come out of the
door on the other side, kill it in the same manner as the previous one, and enter
the new area, there will be some more scuttlers here and an adrenaline hypo on the
table. Head a little forward and the final walker will burst out of another door.
Kill this one and PhEW , your done. Check the crates in front of you, Blow them and
you will get the shotgun (yeAH BABY) . Then go to the room where the final walker
came from and here you will find some ammo for the shotgun in the crates. Get it
and head back to Williams. He will open the Comm Room door for you now.

The first thing to do is get the junction box fixed so taht you can save your game,
do so now and as soon as you try to use the radio 2 walkers and few scuttlers will
attack you. Head to the room with the snooker table and fight your ass off. This
will be your first tough battle . Once it is over William will lead you to the
back exit of this base, follow him and the level will end.

This round consists of 5 main rooms and you will be in the middle with your team.
In the main room you will find a MP5 on the table in front of you . Go to the only
open door right now and go to the door inside it. In this dark room are two pods
which grow scuttlers and a new type of thing hanging from the wall, you can finish
the pods with the flame thrower and until you do the scuttlers will keep coming.
Kill that thing on the wall and fix the junction box.

Now you have access to another one of the rooms in the main room. That room is
the radio room, once you enter that room you will see that it is ver dimly lit,
but you should see a save spot and some canisters for the blow torch, In the
corner of the room is the empty hole where once the radio was. Now begins the
fight of the game so far. Waves and waves of scuttlers will come from the broken
glasses , trust me, when i say waves i mean alot of waves.

After you kill all the scuttlers which come from the window of this room head to
the main room, if you didnt already knew that then the room on the north is full
of ammo and there are a few health packs. You can use this room to stock up ammo
when ever you are low. There is also a broken glass in this room, and a lot more waves
of scuttlers will come from them.

Once you clear this room (finally) the battle is still not over now the third part of
the scuttler wave attack begins in the room where you first went and when you dispose
of ALL OF THEM , the battle is still not over. Now 2 walkers will break the main door and
attack you. Give them the old weakining and then flaming routine and soon they will be
dead. Once they are toast go out of the hole which they made and head down the stairs
and you will see a little cutscene in which that mysterious man is shown running away.
Now head to the right hand side and you will see a trailer but a wlaker bursts out of
it and attacks you. Kill it and search the trailer for 2 blowtorches and alot of fuel
canisters.

When you are full on flames head to that place with the blue lights where you
saw that man running and continue on taht path until the level ends.

When the level starts you will see a little FMV of that mysterious man running
in the warehouse and closing the door behind him, when you are in control head
forward into the main area and from there head towards building 1 which should
be just in front of you.

When you enter the building you will face some scuttlers , those shouldnt be any
problem for you right now, kill them and take any ammo scattered. For a quick
thing leave your both NPC's here and carry on to the next room, here you will
find a flare, and if you keep on going you will come to a room with a stair case .
You will face some scuttlers here but they are easy, and upon killing the scuttlers
head up the staircase and onto the roof of building 1.

If you look closely you will see a grate in one of the corners of the roof ,
when you reach it a scuttler will break out and after killing it enter the grate,
now you will be in a dark space with 2 more scuttlers lurking about. Kill them and
you will see another grate on the metalic floor. To make the following part easier
all you have to do is shoot the grate open , but dont jump down yet as there are
2 walkers roaming down there. Instead look for the fuel barrels and shoot them ,
this should kill atleast 1 of them. Now jump down and kill the walkers if they are
still alive.

In this room you should find the key to the weather dome building. After you find
it head outside via the main door and go back to the first building to retreive your
NPC's. Now go to the weather dome building which is a little distance away, and
upon reaching it you will see a little cutscene of that mysterious man etering
the dome of that building.

In this building you will run into some scuttlers in the first room, kill them
all and then search all the lockers for some MP5 ammo, a health kit and a blood test
hypo. After getting the stuff go to the next room and you will finally see a save
game spot. As you are about to save the game you will be attcked by some scuttlers.
After killing them save if you like and head to the next room.

In this room you will see a staircase, but dont climb it yet, there is a body besides
a crate and another path which leads to somwhere, when you reach the body a few
scuttlers will arrive , kill them and enter the further area which is the kitchen.
Inside you will find some ammo for your guns but as you are about to reach them the
room begins to set on fire. Quickly escape the room , donot try to put out this
fire yourself.

Stand outside the room and wait for a little while and the rooms automatic sprinkler
system will come online, and the fire will be put out for you, now you can go in the
room and finish stocking up the weaponry and also pick up the key in the corner of the
kitchen. Once you are fully loaded head up the stairs.

Up the stairs you will see a new kind of a walker, it can make the scuttlers
come out of its stomach, and the newly born scuttlers can throw some green stuff
at you which makes you slow. There will be alot of scuttlers in this room,
so you need to be careful, dispose of them with calmness , dont be paniced all of a sudden.

Once cleared , go to the room on the left, this room is a toilet, look for
health packs, and when you advance further in the toilet a walker will charge at
you, dispose of it quickly because newly formed acid scuttlers will now be in
the previous room. Kill them all and search for a blood test hypo in the rest room.
Once you do that go back to the main room and kill any scuttlers left, and then
check the PC in the corner for some more story info.

After doing all that head up the stairs and another cutscene begins with the
inevitable demise of pierce (poor man). Now pick up the sniper rifle from the
crate and its ammo besides it. Now check the PC and see through the telescope
for some viewing. Not exit this room and go down, and behind the door where you
came in from, you will see somee fuel drums here, blow them and a narrow path to
the warehouse is now visable, go across carefully :p. When on the ledge of
the warehouse, go to the right path and follow the railing. In the way there
will be some scuttlers in the way , kill them and continue the path until you see
a grate in the wall, shoot it open and continue to end the level.

In the cutscene of this level you will see that another NPC collins is trapped in
the room and there are scuttlers and a new four legged walker roaming outside his room,
kill them all ( i make it sound so easy , dont I? ) and find the small junction box which
is hidden in the small corner . When the power has been restored go talk to collins.

See that other locked door, you will be coming here later in the level , dont worry.
For now go to the PC in the room with collins and you will have a nice change in the
objectives. Now give him some weapons and tell him to follow you. Take him with you and
go to the further side of the ramp and you will see stairs leading down to the floor of the warehouse.

When you reach the floor of the warehouse you will see a junction box nearby which
collins can repair, as he is doing so you you will be attacked by some scuttlers
and 3 walkers, if you are quick enough there is are fuel drums which can damage a walker
a little. Now the best thing to do here is to slowly walk up on the stairs and
shoot while retreating, and once the walkers are in red flame em and fry em. When all
those things are finally finished go down to the warehouse floor again.

there is a large trailer in one corner which has 4 MP5 ammo clips and in the other
corner there is some shotgun ammo, but you will be attacked by some scuttlers when
you approach that ammo. Now check the corpse and besides him is a notice which tells you what to do.

Now have collings fix the junction box which opens that door on the stairs,
now you have access to run over one of the hands of the large crane. Run on
top of it and climb to the top of the beams. When your at the top you will
see a shotgun ammo box in one of the corners , if you are short on ammo go there,
otherwise go to the other direction, the other path will lead you to the small office
near where the level started, now you can break in from the top and fall
down in that office.

In that office there is a PC to continue the story a little bit and also there is
the key card, pick it up and open the door, now go back to the door which was on
the warehouse floor, and now you will be able to open it. If collins is still
alive then  i advice you to kill him because he will change here indefinetly. In
this newly opened room ther is a saveagame spot (finally), and stairs leading down.

Dont forget to save your game here and head down the stairs and continue the path
to face the first big boss thing.



############################## 

BOSS FIGHT 1 ( The Radio Man )

##############################




Quick advice, press the back and right moving keys as the cutscene is happening,
and as soon as the fight starts, you will hopefully be able to duck the first shot,
now hide in the corner and look at the monstrocity you are about to face ,
you need a good weapon to turn all the target areas on this boss red. The weapon of
choice here is MP5. I advice you to hide in that corner where there are all the crates.

Now the boss will have some targets at its base , and those are your concern, as
you are shooting the boss will make a hole in the wall near the crates. This will
reveal a pod which makes scuttlers, quickly get into first person and torch the pod. Then
shoot at the base of the boss until all the targets are red. THen you get a target at
the top of the boss, and once you turn that red aswell a small cutscene starts in which
you finally see the radio man you were looking for, but he is the head of that boss thing.

Somewhere near this point, some tentacles will break through a grate in the other
corner of the room, you should get rid of them immediately by shooting as they can be
a real pain in the butt. Now shoot open all the crates that are near you, and you  will find
some fire grenades, just the thing. Throw them at the body of the boss and soon
its gonna be over.

As the boss is finished fix the junction box and the door will open allowing you
to end the level.

When the level starts you will be near a hole , you should fall down and
go left, here you will find a few doors and they have numbers on top of
them, look inside each room and remember their numbers, were gonna be doing
something about it later.

Now go back the way you came and go to the other path . In this area as soon
as you enter some scuttlers will start to come out of the vent ducts, if your
quick enough you can shoot the duct and they wont come out. There are two
paths in this room, take the left one for now and carry on. You will be in
a room with a broken ramp in front of you. climb the ramp and look for the small
drums or patches of fuel on the ground. Start the fire and soon it will spread
in the whole room. There will be a door near you which has its entrance covered
by fuel drums. The fire will reach it and blow the drums.

Now that the door is clear arm the fire extinguished and become a fireman. When
the fire is cleared go into that little room and here you will find some ammo ,
health kits and another entinguisher. Now extinguish your path to the next room
and you will be in a small hall, turn to the left and after a small walk open
the door to the left with a lot of stuff in it. There is also a save station here
so you know what to do.

Here you will see four marked switches in one corner, all you need to do is open
door 1 and 4 ,but since 1 is broken you can only open 4, and the door across the
entrace of this room (operations room) will open. Now head there and continue the
little hall and there will be the open door. Now you are in a maze with some
oversized scuttlers , they look bigger but they are the same, trust me. When you
have passed the maze ssuccesfully you will come to the room of the hydrolic switch
and there will be a walker waiting. Kill it and open the switch. Then make your
way all the way back to the operations room. In the way will be another walker
waiting kill it and go to the op room.

Now open the remaining switches and you will open the door to the lab and the
other one will open the door to the little room  with the walker, but wait ,
there will be fire in the hall quickly so dont forget to equip the fire
extinguisher before you leave. Now head back to the place where this level
started. Put out the fire and get rid of the walker. Inside that room will be a
blood test hypo and a grenade launcher.

Now head to the door of the prep lab and then on to the next room and this round
is over.

Once this level starts you should know this that in this level your main obective
is to search for a man Dr Farady. When your in control go to the next room, this
room has a few scuttlers and 2 walker, one of which spawns scuttlers out of his
stomach. This will be a hard fight , and the best thing to do here is to hit and
run for your life. After you have cleared this room look for that first aid kit
cabinet on the wall, its got more then enough and you should full up.

Go to the room on the left hand corner and you will find price in there who
informs you that 2 of his men are in the prison, and as he tells you a
scuttler will emerge, kill it and ask price to come with you.

Take any thing in this room and head to the main room, from there look for
the door with the broken junction box and have price fix it, inside are some
treats for you and a blood test hypo, give a weapon to him and some ammo too.

When your all done here go to the final room left, this rooom has a staircase
in it and there will be few scuttlers here to fend off. Take care of them and
descend the stairs. In the room below are a savegame spot some CCTV cameras
and some more switches marked 1 to 9. You need to take a look at CCTV's and
open the best way to faraday, or if you like it you can open all of the doors.

Once done here head down again and now you will be at the entrance of the chamber,
there is a medic in the first room but too bad that he is infected and he will
soon reveal himself. There will be some scuttlers in this area, now work your way to
faraday and when you reach him there will be another cutscene, the best thing is that
faraday is a healer as well so this is good for you. Now make your way back and take
faraday with you, you will encounter alot of scuttlers in the way but nothing you
cant handle.

easy combo for the door ( 9 8 6 3 2 ) open em in this order.

Now head back to the way you started this level with faraday, and in the main
room you will see some scuttlers, head back to the prep lab room and kill the
walker here, make sure you kill the tentacles and those large things on the walls
before you exit this level.

At the start of this level you have nothing with you so be very very careful.
Now when your off the table go to the room besides the place where you are and
fix the box to turn the power on, take a note at the table taht if you were still there.

Now check the PC's and the CCTV camera's in the same room, and you should see
a walker there. Now the next part is really clever and requires good control
over blake, open the door to the area where the walker is, then make him chase
you and take a round of the table and close that door while your outside meaning
that you trapped the walker inside. :)

In front you will be a box you cant fix yourself and a dead corpse with 2 MP5
clips, go to the left hand side and you will find another box which you can fix
so do so and enter the room to find another NPC Falcheck, he doesnt trust you now
so give him the ammo and ask him to follow you outside.

Lead him down the hall and you will pass another bad PC which explodes as you
pass, you will find another clip on top of a crate there, if you head forward
you will see 2 doors, and a dead body, a scuttler will come out of it and have
flacheck dispose it. Read the file besides the body for the story sake.

(the following part i read from another place )

Now ask flacheck to stand there and go back to the room where you trapped the
walker, force him to come outside and make him follow you to the room where
you found flacheck. Once in there take it to the corner and quickly dis from
its side and close the door behind you to trap this walker forever, if you were
injured go to flacheck and get healed.

(end of that)

Now head back to flacheck and take him to the examination room, there open the
door on the other side and you will face a few scuttlers, so now kill them and
in the little room in the corner you will find a file and a flashlight. Fix the
box there and you will open the next door, here you will find another NPC who
is injured so have your medic heal him and get outta this room, as you are leaving
you will be attacked by scuttlers, so you should try to seal them in this room
and close the door with your team on the other side.

Now take dixon the engineer to the box which you couldnt fix , that door leads
to the armory and it has all the right ingrediants in there, when the door s
open rush inside and you will find the treat of a lifetime, as you are taking
weapons a grate on the wall bursts and out come a few scuttlers, give dix a weapon
quickly so taht they can fight while you are picking up the weapons.

NOw go down to the hall where you saw the two doors, and fix the box to open the
door there, kill the scuttlers and enter the first room you see, this is a savegame
room, it also has a PC which tells you about the armory and a machine gun
cam which you can use to fire a secutiry gun.

Now head back to the other door with a man inside, that man is carter but he is
infected and he could turn anytime at all, so keep a good eye at him, then enter
the other door in that room and you will come to a puzzle , the answer is to tuen
off the first and the last switches and the puzzle is over.

Then down the hall enter the next room which is the prison room, here use the
PC to find the cell of the person fisk and go free him, then check him with the
blood test hypo and carter is the one who loses his skins and reveals himself,
give a weapon to fisk at once as he is a soldier and he is a good shot.

Now search for the prison with the grate inside, make sure that you have the
flamethrower with you at this time, go into the duct and follow the path until
you come to a balcony , from here you can see two walkers roaming downside but
they cant do anything as you are on higher grounds.

There are 2 flame grenades you so pick them up and then weaken the walkers with
ammo and then use the grenades to finish em off. Now jump down and open the door
and let dixon come in, ask him to fix the box there, and the pC will become
operational, use it to find the code of the elevator, and head there to finish the level.

As the level starts pick the MP5 from the lift and give good guns to your
team, when you enter the area you will see the soldiers coming after you,
kill them now and head to the left door, as you are crossing you will be attacked
by 4 or 5 differnet waves of soldiers, kill them all and enter the big area. You
see some scuttlers in tubes, no need to piss them off, have dixon fix the box
there while you go up to that control booth over there.

In there you see a fire extinguisher, and some health packs in the cabinet and
also thers a machine gun cam there , but you dont need to shoot at anything,
now get out and look for three crates under neath the control room, 2 of them
have ammo in them and 1 has scuttler.  Meanwhile Dixon should be finished with
the box and the door should open.

You will find some grenades a shotgun and a MP5 in the room , then go all
the way back to the room where you started the level from and you will be
attacked by some scuttlers, now enter the door where the first soldiers came
from. Now take a peek at the corner and you see quite a few soldiers waiting for
you, the best thing to do here is throw a stun grenade and then pick em off one
by one. There is a switch at the end, if you are able to keep the soldiers
away from it then the gun turret will remain off, otherwise....

Take your team to the end of the hall where you find a locked door and a grate
in the wall, you know what to do so shoot open the grate and enter it, inside you
will face atleast 2 scuttlers. When you are at the other end shoot the grate and as
soon as you fall get ready to run because the floor will cover with fire in no
time, in the way you will see a walker but ignore it and run past it, the fire will
take care.

In the next room are some scuttlers needing to be killed , after you kill em go
to the far left hand corner to enter a room with some health packs, return to the
main room and go check the switchs in the middle and you get a change in the
objectives now, head to the door on the far right and fend off the scuttlers as you go.

You will come to a choice of 2 doors, ready the guns and open the door, there are
a lot of scuttlers here, but all you need to do is hit the fuel drum at the end and
its all over , but the room gets set on fire. Wait a little while and then enter the
room when the fire stops, fix the box on the other side and go back ouside to the other door.

Here you will see a drum so blow it and kill all the hanging scuttlers, then pick
up any ammo you see here and now head to the pressure control tank and fix it, this
opens the switches so head back to the switch room.

In the switch room open the switch in the corner and it will flame the two walkers
who are inside the other room, now open all the other switchs and you will see another
door open in the corner, but you dont need to go there now, for now get your team and
have dixon fix the little box in the corner , and then you will be able to access
the savegame spot. Finally

Save the game and head to the other newly opened door, inside when you go a little
further a trooper charges at you, but there are explosives at the ground so all you
need to do is hit them and bye trooper.

Now peek around the corner and you see a gun turret waiting, the best thing to do here
is throw a HE grenade if you have one, and the gun will fry , take dixon and fix
the box at the end, but be ready as there will be 2 troopers coming out of the elevator,
once they are done for enter the lift and the next round loads.

###########################



As the level starts you will be in a furnace room with 2 different furnaces on each
side of the room, and this room also has a walker, if you want to make it easier you
can trap and press one of the buttons besides the furnaces to make an explosion. The
easiest way to trap is to make it follow you in the middle area, and be sure to let
your NPC's stay in the lift.

When this is done and the walker has been killed open the large door besides the furnaces
and enter the area, this area has 2 floors , one upper and one lower, in the lower area
there are a few soldiers and crates, once they see you they will come at you from the stairs,
kill them all and take their ammo.

After the area has been cleaned go to the room with the broken box in the left
hand side and have dixon repair the box so that you can open the door. Once the
door is open you will have another cutscene and you will be introduced to another
NPC who'se name is Temple, he tells you that whitley shot him, but why ? that
is the question.

In this room you will see a gun camera , and if you access it you will see that
some soldiers are in the lower area, make quick work of them , if any of them survive
the gunfire then they will charge towards the stairs and that is where they are the
most vulnerable.

Once you have dispoed of the soldiers read the pc for some strange information about
a gun and pick up the sniper rifle and the ammo with it. Now go downstairs and get the
door infront of you fixed by dixon, in this room you will find a flamethrower and
health packs, and the dead body will throw out some scuttlers as well.

One of the crates in the main room also holds a health pack, go to the room
behind the stairs and you will see a savegame spot there along with some ammo
and HE grenades, stock up here and get out.

Once this is done go back upstairs and to the right hand area , there is a door
there but as you reach it a soldier will come out , kill him and then enter the area,
there is a NPC here who doesnt trust you one bit so pick up the blood test hypo there and
take the test in front of him, now he will be a friend , so give him a weapon, and take
the MP5 ammo in the same room before leaving.

When all of this is done go back downside and go to the room in the far corner,
there will be 2 switches for this door, and they will both be needed pressed. When
you open the door you will see some soldiers on the other side, kill them all
and get the ammo they leave. When the room is clean go to the only door there.

Now you are in a spiral staircase room, climb down the staircase and watch out for
the tripwire bomb on the way down, blow the bomb with any gun and make your way
down to the next door.

Now you will enter a long and dark tunnel , when you enter be sure to turn on the
flashlight, as you wont be able to see anything without. Turn right and go forward
until you see a truck, dont go near it and shoot the fuel drums from a distance otherwise
there are a lot of scuttlers there.

When the way is clear you can search the areas around the truck for some grenades and a
box which turns on the tunnel's lighting system, but as soon as you turn it on a few
soldiers and a walker get alerted. Head to the other end of the tunnel and get rid of
the soldiers, if you have the sniper rifle dont hesitate in using it , and pick off
the soldiers with clean head shots, there is also a walker in there, and you can kill
it with the normal routine.

There is a little nook in the tunnel and in that area there is a gun cam which you
can use to kill any soldiers which were left alive and also blow the two bombs you see
with the guncam, this will clear the way forward for you.

When you clear the way move forward and you will see some more soldiers and some gun
crates, after you kill all the soldiers restock your ammo and your partners aswell. Have
 the engineer fix the box in the end of the tunnel to open the door at the end. In this new
large room you will see a human standing on top of the stairs but he quickly becomes a
monster and you know what to do . Now in this room there is some ammo scattered here and
there, and some flame grenades and a launcher near some crates.

When you get all of that go up the stairs and you will be in a room with a savegame
spot, and a junction box, as soon as your done fixing it some scuttlers and walkers will
come out and you should kill them as soon as possible, when you are done i advice you to save
your game quickly and head down and open the door to face the second big thing.



################################## 

BOSS FIGHT 2 ( Twin Necked freak )

##################################



When you open the door a nice little cutscene will introduce you and you will see
the boss in it, but your team is nowhere to be seen, thats cause the door closed
and they were left out. This boss is a little different from the first boss and it
needs a little careful planning to be killed. Dont just run in charging at it, even
thought its attacks seem to be slow they can cause a lot of damage per hit.

Once you are in control again head a little forward and fix the box which you see ,
this will turn on the wrech machinery. Now head back and stand in behind the crates in
such a way that you can see the boss from there, now equip the HE grenades, if you dont
have them then this boss will be a little tougher to kill. Go into first person view
so that you can properly aim the grenades, now aim the grenades and throw them towards
the thing moster, make sure that you dont throw them a little too close because they
can still harm you even if your behind the crates. Thats why they are called High
Explosive grenades.

Throw atleast six grenades so that the boss gets his health meter in red, and if you run
out of the HE grenades dont hesitate to use the regular green grenades.

Now if you have some flame grenades go charge in and throw the grende and get out
of harms way as soon as you can, if the boss hits you then you will suffer alot,
you can take no more then 4 hits from the hands of the boss, once you hear the
boss roar it means that it was hurted by the grenades. After he is really really
weak equip your flamethrower and head for the switch which was in the same area as
the boss, when you press the switch the boss gets a electic shock and its head will
drop down but only for a few seconds. Take this time and hit the boss in the part
where its neck divides. It will get hurt again, if it doesnt die in the first try
keep following the steps until it dies.


-------


Once it is dead your team comes in , now turn on the switch which was behind the
thing monster, this switch was previously inaccessable, this switch opens the final
door of this level, and when you head there, there will be a box needing some repairs.
When it is repaired you will see a cutscene after which you got only 35 seconds to
escape to the life which was besides that gun cam back in the tunnel.

35 seconds may sound a little less, but it is enough and you can even pick up ammo
in the way if you like too. When you reach the life we see that only blake is able
to enter the lift and any other NPC's that you had will die. :( there is no way to change
this so dont think of loading the precious save.

This level is a little long so you need to be patient, and you will start this
level in the snow, this level will have alot of troopers in it so you should be
at your guard at all times.

Move forward when you are in control , and you will see a large building with
soldiers roaming outside, they can die with almost any weapon so the choice is
yours. Kill the soldiers outside, and head inside, kill any soldiers inside and move
to the right hand side and around the corner you will find some sniper rifle ammo.
Head back to the other side and dont forget to take the health packs from inside the
truck. Now head towards the door on the left side of the main room.

The room you come into is really small and only has another door on the other side,
once you open that door there will be a soldier in it, quickly kill him before he
gets the chance to turn on the alarm, because if he does then you will have to face the
reinforcements. Make sure taht you kill him quickly, One of the two doors here is
locked , and you cannot get into it until the very later stages of the level.

In the next room there will be a soldier around the corner, kill him and head for
the next room , go to the next room here, and then again to the next room, where you will
see 2 soldiers , kill them and use the PC to learn something about the C4 which you will
need later in this level. In this same room there is a broken junction box for the holding
room, but you cant fix it on your own, and you will need an engineer later in this level.

Go to the next room and you will fight some scuttlers here, dispose of them and enter
the next room, where there will be a walker in a tank in one corner and you will have to
fight a few troops, keep the firing clare of the tank so that the walker doesnt get free,
this is just to make it easier for you, as you can fight the walker at will if you want to.

After that go into the next hallway and be prepared to kill three more soldiers, and
then in the next room another soldier needs to be killed. Then go to the room near the
bottom of the ramp and quickly kill the 2 soldiers shooting at the NPC. After you kill them
enter the room with the NPC and another cutscene begins in which you are introduced to
powell, give him a weapon and make him your friend, then ask him to fix the junxtion box
in the same room.

With this box fixed you will be able to use the savegame spot and the door
to the storage room opens, inside the storage room you will find guns and ammo,
and also 2 scuttlers will be there, save the game at this point because this
is a valueablLee place.

Leave this room and another soldier will attack you, kill him and exit the door,
then head left and you will find another soldier, aftet killing him pick up the
fire extinguisher which is lying on the crates, and enter the door in the other corner.

Now descend the staircase and kill any scuttlers which may try to stop you on
the stairs, after that go down and enter the room in front of the stairs, have
powell fix the box and enter the room besides the box, in this room you will
see some fuel drums in the end , you can destroy them now and hope that they
take care of the scuttlers who are waiting around the corner. Once the scuttlers
are dead continue in this room and you will see a window through which you
can see some soldiers waiting for you. You will find some Mp5 ammo aswell as
sniper rifle ammo. There should also be a door control here .

Now exit this room and enter the room besides it and you will face the soldiers
you saw in the window, after they are done for have powell repair the box which
will allow you to save your game, then save the game and open the door on the far
side of this room, you will see a walker and 2 scuttlers trapped in glass containers,
only break the container with the walker and kill it with the usual method, once it
is dead head inside and pick up the key which opens the door to the room with the C4.

Return to the previous room and open the other door you see , inside this door
there will be health packs and a flashlight waiting to be picked, and then grab the
C4, you actually not use it in this level but in the next level, as soon as you
pick them up the alarm goes off and the base is now swarmed with troopers.

NOw your main objective has become to escape the building from the main exit  where
you came in from the first place, ,you will encounter a lot of soldiers along the
way so be sure to kill them all , continue your path backwards, and when you reach the
room where the walker was in the glass tank, it will now be free and there will also
be some scuttlers. Kill them all and continue through the small halls and you will come to
the room where 2 soldiers are hitting the walker, stand in the corner and let them
weaken or even kill the walker, then get rid of the soldiers, in the very next room
you will face another walker , kill it . This is the room with the broken junction box
to the holding room. Have your engineer fix it for you and when it is fixed enter this room.

See that large body hanging in the corner, it will terrify powel good, so you should
be real quick and go to the box in the corner and ask powel to fix it before he
flips out,when the box is fixed quickly use the PC , and you will get the key code for
that locked door we saw earlier in the level ,now if you have an adrenaline hypo use
it on powell immediately and get the hell out of this room, because if you stay
in this room long enough, he will shoot himself.

Now head on to that door and you will encounter another walker along the way, inside that
locked room you will find a g launcher , some ammo and a save game spot. Save
the game here and now head for the main door, along the way you will find 2 soldiers
waiting, so its your choice that you can either kill them or make a dash for the main door.

Once you reach the main door the level is over and the next one starts loading.

This level starts out in the snow so you need to be careful of the time, and
if you saved powell from the previous level then he might help you in this level
a little.

As soon as the level starts head forward and you will see the first hanger, and
it will be guarded by one soldier, if he sees you he will make a dash for the alarm
so make sure that you kill him quickly, head inside the hanger and place the C4 on
the red box which appears in front of the plane. There is nothing else to see here
so exit this hanger and head directly straight so that you get to the other hanger.

In the other hanger there will also be a soldier like the previous one, kill him
quickly and enter the hanger, in this hanger again place the bomb on the plane, and
then head to the back side of the hanger and you will see alot of ammo lying on the floor,
but when you get near it a few scuttlers will attack you, kill them quickly and grab
all the ammo. There may also be more ammo besides this one so search the hanger .

Then head outside the second hanger and turn left and continue on the path with the
steel wires in the way, follow this path and you will eventually come to the third hanger,
enter this hanger and place the C4 like the previous planes, then exit this hanger and
go to the last hanger directly in front, in the final hanger place the C4 on the plane
and make sure that you have a sniper rifle , if you dont then there is one lying in the
backside of this hanger.

Once you have placed all 4 charges head back to the main building where two soldiers are
standing guard, this building is in front of the first two hangers, so head there.

In the main building kill the troopers and enter inside, inside in the square hallway
kill the walker that is roaming here and there and fix the junction box in the left side
of the hall and enter this little staff room. Inside this room you will find a savegame spot
, a key, a PC, and a flashlight, but as soon as you pick anything up a walker and
scuttlers will attack you in this room, this is a small room so the fight will be
rough. After you kill them use the PC and pick up the key and the flashlight, and dont
forget to save the game.

Now exit this small room and turn left and head towards that door in the left area, inside
the door are 2 other doors with broken junction boxes. Fix these boxes, the maintainese area
box doenst need an engineer, but the data room box needs an engineer to fix it, if
you had saved powell from the previous round and if he is still alive in this round
then have him fix the door and inside you will find ammo boxes and a save game spot.

Now head toward the maintainence door, inside this room you will find some scuttlers, and
 in one area you will see a fuel drum, blow it as soon as you see it because there are
scuttlers around the corner and also a walker , and they will hopefully be damaged.
Now head around the corner and you will see a walker attacking a NPC who is sitting
down on his knees because he is hurt bad, kill the walker quickly and pick up the
health pack which is besides the NPC. Heal this person Reed and give him a waepon so
that he trusts you now, Reed is a medic and thats good :).

NOw head back to the staff room and save your game or even at the data room.
Head towards the final two doors in the main square hallway, one of these doors is
a bathroom with nothing inside but the other door which goes into the tower is
actually the door to a staircase which will lead you to the top of the tower. Along
the way you will face come scuttlers but they are no real threat , so carry on
and exit the door at the top of the stairs.

Once you are at the top there are 2 rooms here, one of the rooms will show you
a little cutscene and there is a sniper rifle ammo pack there, and the other room
has a walker and a save game spot, dont do any shooting just yet, first kill the
walker and then save your game. The following part requires you to be extremely
quick and good with the sniper rifle.

Ok now you need to shoot the C4's you placed with the help of the snier rifle,
the best tactic here is to stand in the middle parts of the rooms , ie the middle
windows. Now zoom in , dont zoom to the max because it makes the aiming slow,
instead zoom in enough that you can see the C4 box, aim at it carefully and fire,
as soon as you blow the first one the doors will start to close, so now shoot the
other C4 and head back to the other room in the tower, now do the same
as before really really quickly.

Once you do this correctly you will see a little cutscene of a few walkers and
scuttlers entering the main tower through the area where you found reed in the
first place. Now this tower will also have troopers, and you should meet some
of them at the exit of the top of the tower.

Now head down the tower and to the area where you saw the walkers come in, kill them
all and enter the duct you see in the snow, take all the weapons from your NPC's
because they arent coming with you, and besides the next round is a hell.

enter the duct and the next round begins

When this level starts you will be in the ducts, head down the duct and drop in
the cavey area, this is dark area so turn on your flash light, there is a shack in
the corner and a junction box, repair it and the shack door will open, but there
will be a walker in it , kill it quickly and grab the grenade launcher, the health
packs and ammo's inside that shack.

When you reach near the elevator a few scuttlers will drop from above and will attack
you, kill them and head up the rocky ramp, when you near the duct at the end a
scuttler will charge at you, kill it and enter the ducts, when you are at the first turn
in the ducts, a few scuttlers will attack you from all the directions, kill them all
and pick up the pistol clip here, and continue forward to get the MP5 clips. When you
reach the end of the ducts drop down and you will see a NPC Cohen running away, quickly
give him some ammo and weapon and let him go where he is going, you stand right there
and wait for the soldiers who are coming, kill them and then go after cohen.

This area is really really bad because every dead body lying here and there
will throw out atleast 5 or 6 scuttlers and they will be really bad. There are
also gonna be soldiers when you head down the path and also almost every turn
has a gun turret with it, but where there's a turret there's always an easy way
to kill it like drums or crates to hide behind.

Remember to look over ramps to the down areas so that you can find any drums
that will help you destroy turrets, as you are progressing there will be a
few soldiers in the way which shouldnt be a threat, but the real problems here
are the scuttlers , because they come too many in numbers, every downed body you
see will spawn atleast 4 to 6 scuttlers, so always be on your guard when you are
near dead bodies.

Once you are almost at the bottom you will face a hell lot of scuttlers and also there
will be a walker, so hand cohen a lot of ammo and leave him outside the door you
are about to enter, as soon as you enter the door, you will see two gun turrets
in front of you and there will be crates at the left side under which you can hide.

Now there are 2 ways to get rid of the turrets , 1 is taht you stay in
the rear areas of the room because the turrets cant hit with accuracy at long ranges,
and the other way is to blow the crates you are behind and enter this room, inside
this room there will be a switch on the wall, hit it once to deactivate the turrets, there
 is also a savegame spot in this room and a shotgun and shotgun ammo. Save your
game here and proceed to the next door.

But before you do that head back outside and get cohen if he is still alive
taht is, and take him inside, then ask him to stay in the first room as
you go to the other. In this room head straight to that little store room like thing
and quickly throw the switch, this will deactivate one of the two turrets on the walls,
the other choice is yours, either you can shoot it or you can make a run for it
and press the switch which is on a wall near that turret.

Then go back and bring cohen in this room, and take the pistol ammo in the little store
room if needed, also there will be a health pack and a sniper rifle ammo pack under
the place where the turret is. Now head to the next room but keep cohen in this room.


Now enter the final room which is the toughest in this area , this room has a total
of 4 turrets, and the switches in the room dont do you any good either, one of the switches
is in the room in the right side of this room , this switch will turn the turrets in
the far side off , but they turn on the turrets near the door. The other switch will do the
same, as it only turns one pair of turrets on and the other pair off.

The best advice i can give you is to hide in the small room at once, and from
there get the two sentries which are deactivated and then press the switch
and the other 2 will also become deactivated so you can destroy them easily, once
the room is clear pick up the MP5 ammo's in this little room, and go and get
cohen in this room, before you proceed to the d0or which finished this level, be
sure to take all the weapons from cohen because he is not comming with you in the
next round.

Head through the final door and the next round starts to load.

When this round starts you will see john travolta and nicholas cage pointing guns,
or rather it is ryan and stolls. Before you do anything it is your decision to
decide who is the thing and who is not. But before we do that take the taser and
the 2 health packs on this side of the table, and then go to the other side and
get the blood test hypo, then use it on ryan and you will see that he is the thing,
kill him like any other and give stolls a good weapon.

Ask stolls to follow you and take him to the room on the other side of the
checkpost which is the robotics room. In this room you will see a machine working
in front of you , and besides it a MP5 clip, pick it up and have stolls repair
the junction box of the data room there , when the room is open head inside and
stock up the ammo and also save the game at the savegame spot.

Get out of this room and around the corner of the data room you will see a
CCTV, and a guncam which are currently turned off, you need to turn on the
power to turn them on. So now head up the ramp on the other side and have the
engineer fix the broken junction box there, when that is done you will see
that the power is on and that there are a number oc PC's in the office cubical,
you can check all of them for the sake of the story if you want, when you are about to search
the final PC a walker and scuttlers will break a nearby wall and attack you. Kill it
 and take the 2 grenades on the final desk.

Now head back down the ramp and then another cutscene begins, now you will be told
what you need to do so no need for me to right that all down here, look at the
CCTV and when you see stolls open the first door open the second door at once
and he will pass through it and jam it for you, now comes the shooting part,
active the gun cam and you will see a few scuttlers and three scuttler spawning pods,
and then there will be an explosion and the room may get a little fire. Shoot
the scuttlers and their pods with the gun cam, and now head to that door yourself.

When you raech you will see two doors heading inside, take a look in the door
to the right and you will see that poor old stolls was also a monster, kill him and
take the ammo and there will also be a pistol ammo box in the room if needed.

Now head to the last door and when you do another cutscene begins in which that guy
leads you to a trap room, you will be trapped inside the room and gas starts to fill
it, you only have 30 seconds to do something or else your toast. The solution to this
is that you fix the junction box. Now head to the right hand side of the room and
you will see another machine gun camera, use it and turn it to the right, you will
see a tank which is leaking the green gas, shoot it open and not only will the timer
stop but also the door will blow open.

In the same room there are fuel canisters and 2 PC's. Make sure that you use both
of them , one of them will show you a good message from whitley and the other will show you
a small cutscene of the soldiers. Now head to the starting room of this level and you
will see that the soldiers left the door with the red lights inside open. Dont charge
inside because there is a gun turret around the corner, you can either play the sneaking
game or just throw a HE grenade to destroy the damn thing.


Now head to the next room where you will see a scuttler spawning pod in the
floor, burn it before it can produce any more scuttlers. In the next room
turn right and fix the junction box you see, inside this room are 3 CCTV's
which will show you a glimpse of thigns to come. Now head back to the left side
towards the large glass windowed room you see above the stairs, 2 soldiers will
attack you ,kill them and head below the stairs of the observation room and
turn on its power. Now head up the stairs and you will see another NPC standing in
the room. His name is Peltola, give him a good weapon and some ammo. Before you
exit this room use the machine gun camera and destroy the crates that are
blocking your path to the weapons room, there is also a walker in this room, and if
you can get it make it weak with the guncam.

Now head to the weapons room and kill all that is left of the walker and take
the key that is on the table in this room, exit the room and have the enginer fix the
junction box to the data control room, then this room is open head inside and
stock up on the weaponry you see, also save the game because something really bad is
about to happen.

Ask him to stay here and you head yourself to the final door, but dont open it
yet, take a 180* from there and you will see a shelf lined with grenades and ammo's
, if your already not full then this is the place. Take all you can and open the
final door where you will be greeted by 2 soldiers, kill them and enter the
last room of this level.



################################## 

BOSS FIGHT 3 ( The Roof Breaker )

##################################



When you enter the final door a little cutscene will introduce you to the third thing
boss, this is the hardest boss in the game byfar if you dont know the proper
technique to kill it, inside this same room is a walker held in a glass container besides the boss.

Here is the trick to beating this boss, when you enter the room run straight, dont even
move a little bit, stand right at the face of the boss, so close that it wouldnt be
able to hit you, if you manage to do this then you are in a really nice place, from here you
can shoot the boss until its red , and then you should blow the tank of the walker and try to kill
it, BUT RemEMBER , dont leave that place where you are standing or else the boss
will get you. Try to kill the walker from the same place where you are. If he comes
close to you use the flamethrower of if it stays away then the only thing to do
is to throw a flame grenade.

When the walker is dead its time to kill the main boss. To kill the boss throw
a flame grenade right underneath it and run quickly back , keep on retreating back so
that the grenade doesnt affect you, if the boss doenst die in the first grenade then
the second should definetly kill him. When it is dead then a new objective will be
added to your list which is escape.

Original Message :

=========================================================================================
Would like to add this strat that NOBODY's thought of concerning Boss 3 (that I
discovered and it works very well, and makes this difficult fight almost too easy):

Part (1) Basically, you have to have your Engineer alive to attempt this EASY strategy.
Get rid of the two bad-guys guarding the second door to the Boss 3 Thing by any means
necessary (usually I open the door and lob a grenade..).  Slowly move into the small
room JUST before the door to activate Boss 3 Thing.  Have your engineer follow you in.
Try to stay away from the second door by hugging the inside wall of the first door so
you won't accidentally trigger the Boss 3 scene.  Order your engineer to stand still/stay
put.  SLOWLY, CAREFULLY bump him/move him against the second door that activates the Boss
3 Thing.  Always make sure you are nudging him slightly towards the second door and that
HE is in front of YOU.  Believe it or not, when he gets bumped close enough, your Engineer
will OPEN the second door to the Boss 3 scene WITHOUT starting the scene.  As long as YOU
don't go any further, you can move slightly to the right of your Engineer (NOT forward!)
and shoot the Walker across the room in the glass tube so that he will come running OUT
OF the Boss room and into the small room you and your Engineer are in, all the while NOT
triggering the Boss 3 scene.  Back out of the small second room into the larger first area
(with the ammo rack and shooting range) and eliminate the Walker safely from a distance.
Now, once you have accomplished this, you ONLY have to deal with the Boss 3 Thing.  Go back
into the second room, trigger the second door and the Boss 3 scene.

Part (2) MY second trick here is an EASIER variation mentioned in your FAQ:  Simply run TO
the Boss 3 Thing and hit L2 to crouch DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH him.  From here he can't hit you
and basically does nothing at all; no swinging movements, no tentacle slashes or anything.
From this position equip the SHOTGUN, aim up and blast away.  If your targeting circle doesn't
pop up automatically, move out SLIGHTLY(!) and when you see the circle, start blasting away.
About 8-12 blasts and the Boss 3 targeting circle is in the red.  Now THE CHANGE OF STRATEGY
is this next part:  STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE(!) (still kneeling!) and equip the big flamethrower!
AIM UP and let him have it with a two second blast and then stop and don't move.  Sure he
squirms and brushes against you a couple times, but if you notice you are NOT losing much
health (maybe 10-15% each time) because he is not actually attacking you, just brushing
you trying to move away from the flames.  Once he stops moving blast him again for two
seconds and repeat.  Three or four flame jobs done precisely this way and he's finished.
If you have full health going into this you should lose no more than 60%-65% of your health,
just a little below the halfway point and if you think about it, he's probably only really
attacked you maybe ONCE (right when you run towards him to crouch underneath; if you can
run in (zig-zag around) and duck under him without getting hit, you will probably only
lose about 40-50% of your health during this strategy).  If you start to feel uncomfortable,
use one(!) health pack to put you back at 80 or 90% health, but if you do this technique
correctly, and start with full health, you really DON'T HAVE to use one.  I've tested both
parts of this strategy several times and it works very well.

=============================================================================================

Once you get the escape notice then 3 troopers will attack you and you should kill them
immediately, now go and save your game and if that engineer is still alive ask him
to come with you. Now what you have to do is go all the way back to the place where this
level started. When you reach that place then the next area will load.

Basically this is the first part of the 9th level but the main difference is
that your going upwards now and the whole god damn place is on fire,
there will be frequent explosions here so you always need to be on your guard.

When you are at the climbing ramp area is gets very dangerous , make sure
that you arenot going too fast , and stop at every new turn and whenever you are near
any pillar of any metallic piped, because most of the time they will start
having explosions when you are near them , be careful.

Now you have to go to the very top of the tower, because the vent which you used
to enter the tower before is burning. When you are near the top you will see
some soldiers and 2 walkers, let them fight a little bit and they will
make themselves weak, the walkers may even kill the soldiers, then when they are in
red kill the damn walkers, and enter the vent hole right at the top of the tower.
Fall down from the hole in front and proceed to the cavey area.

But there will be 4 fast walkers in the cavey area, the easiest way to
kill them is to lure them behind you and then again retreat inside the vent ,
they cant harm you there, so now they will be easy pickings. When you get rid
of the walkers, head down to the elevator which you couldnt use before, along the way
you will see some scuttlers but they are nothing now.

Get on the elevator and get ready for the next round.

In this round your main enemies will be soldiers, and trust me there will
be alot, when the level starts you will see whitley running away in the
snowey mountainey area. Run after him, and when he turns the corner three soldiers
come out and take their positions, you can hide behind the big rock and take
on them sceakely or you can just charge in and get them in the direct method.

As you kill them make the turn around the corner and you will see some fuel drums,
then you should wait until more soldiers arrive, and when the time is right just
shoot the fuel drums. Then head around the next turn wher the fuel drums
once were and you will see some more soldiers, one of these is a sniper rifle
holder, kill him quickly and once you have cleared the area head inside the small cave
to get some heat and some ammo for your guns.

Once you are all better continue on your path and in the large area you will
see a sniper standing on a high cliff, you can hide behind the large rocks there and
take sneaky shots at the sniper with your own sniper rifle.

When you have cleared the area make the long long journey to the large dome building,
along the way there may be a soldier in the snow, once you have entered the building you
finally have a cutscene in which you see whitley.

Whitley is more powerful then we all imagined, after the cutscene is over
save the game in the savegame spot and on the other side of this room are health
packs. Dont go in the area where whitley went, instead we are going to the
other way, this dome is swarming with soldiers and a lot of trip mines. But
most of the times the dumb soldiers will themselves walk into the trip mines
and blow em up for you to go.

From the starting point of this level head in the left area and you will see
a single soldier , kill him and when you round the corner you will see 5 more waiting to
ambush you, but there is also a fuel drum besides them so the easy way of dropping them
is to blow the drums.

After that is done you can go through the zig zag hall, and along the way you will
see some soldiers, kill them and when you turn the corner you will some more soldiers waiting
for you, so dont disappoint them and now you got a choice of direction.

One of the ways has trip mines in it and you can destroy them to get back
to the starting room of the dome, which means that this is where whitley got out from,
you should save your game again, and then head back to the other path of the choice.
In the other path you see some soldiers so kill them and head down the path, you
will come across a turn with a few crates and 2 fuel drums in different directions, in this
room are also some soldiers in different positions, kill them and in the other end
of the room is the path to the next area. In this area you will have some very
sharp turns and a few of them will have trip wires so be careful.

In this area there will be a soldier around nearly every corner and when you
reach the end you will see three soldiers waiting, kill them and rstock your ammo from
the ammo boxes there and exit the door to reach the snow again.

Now in the snow you will start the great sniper battle , at a little distance you
will see some sniper nests, on them are 5 snipers waiting for you, but there are also
a lot of crates where you are standing so it shouldnt be hard for you to take cover.
There are three ways to finish this.

1. use the sniper rifle and stay behind the cover of the crates, then come out
and take careful headshots to kill the snipers in one shot.

2. If you are not a good sniper you can try to run to the towers and take on
the snipers with your usual methods, but this is very hard as they will never miss
a shot, and you may get killed on the way there.

In these two methods when you have killed the snipers you will see a shed at the
end of the sniper towers, you can go there for some treats, after you have taken them
head to the only path to load the final level .

3. The third method here is the thing which i did in my first time playing the thing.
You can ignore the snipers and you can ignore the treats, and you can make a dash
for the narrow valley which leads to the next level.:)

###########################


In this level you know what to do and when you proceed a little further
you will discover how whitley survived your previous encounter, that is because he is
not a human. He is the final big boss thing of this game. When you proceed a
little more forward you will see a helicopter comming and another cutscnene begins,
after this you will be incharge of the machine gun of the chopper and your pilot
will fly you near the final boss.

The first main targets are the 4 fuel drums which are near the bottom of
the boss, it may seem a little hard to hit at first because the chopper is
moving a lot. But as soon as you get them 4 the gun will turn upwards towards the
upper torso of whitley thing. Here you will see taht a long long tenticle
comes out of his body in a certain position and then it goes back in. That is its
weak spot, keep on hitting him there and soon you shouldve finished the thing.

Enjoy the ending cutscene and try playing the game on hard now.


It wasn't a big room, the one they were in at present. It was a conference-turned-smoking room of a small hotel in suburban New York. In the middle of the room stood seven wrought-iron chairs arranged in an uneven circle, illuminated by the dim yellow light coming from the sole chandelier that adorned the ceiling, one or two bulbs of which kept flickering at odd intervals, drawing attention away from the peeling and moth-eaten yellow wallpaper. It was all pretty clichéd, really.
	But the people who occupied the room were not, even if this small gathering could, indeed, be classified as that of a support group. To an outsider, though no one really knew what this word meant, the scene would have been baffling, unsettling, and downright revolting.
	
	To the right of the two vacant chairs that faced the rotting wooden door, and on the third chair going by that order, was an elderly African man wearing a gown that was predominantly red with orange and yellow tie and dye patterns and a similarly coloured round hat that topped his broad head with small curly white hair.
	To this man's right sat a pale and frail young man of not more than twenty, in a shabby white shirt and black striped trousers that looked like they belonged to the '60s, when in reality, they did. He wore a pair of thick black spectacles, and his lips (that never really met when he wasn't talking) easily betrayed a set of braces.
	On the next chair, strangely, was a young girl still in her late teens. She was clearly Italian-olive skin, black hair, and what not.  A familiar smell of strong disinfectant lingered about her, and seemed to be a fundamental part of her being. She wore a loose brown pant and a pink jumper that was a size too big for her. Her shoulder-length hair was tied in an untidy bundle behind her head, and bobbed a little whenever she moved to ash her cigarette.
	Next to her sat a white man in his early thirties with a clean-shaven head, a French beard, and a heavy tattoo covering his torso. He was wearing a white vest and camouflage cargos with big leather military boots. A big tilted Swastika etched permanently into his skin was visible clearly on his right arm.
	On the last chair before the two vacant ones sat an Afro-American midget wearing an Armani suit, a Rolex watch, and a heavy gold chain. “So?” he said in a thick nasal voice, looking around at the others, “Is that it? Where are the other two?”
	“Maybe they decided against it,” said the girl, “Maybe they won’t come.” 
“Well, they got their reasons, man.” the bald man clubbed in. “Can’t really blame them.”
“God bless them both,” said the African man in a heavy accent. “But we must start as decided.”
The others nodded in agreement and looked at each other a little nervously. Some coughed. Others gained a sudden interest in their hands. Someone pulled a lock of hair behind her ear… and then it started.


1.	In a small village in Zimbabwe, on a particularly dry night, a baby boy was born in a small hut paid for by an American non-profit. His parents were not very well off, but they simply didn’t care about how that could affect bringing up a human child. Some would point out that they were illiterate; others would have heard of a particular sixth sense referred to by most as the common, which was clearly a misnomer.
The village was that of the pigmy tribe ______, that had come into being after their leader had finally decided to give up being a wanderer, and had established a village with the help of a certain missionary who had come with the message of the Christ. That was the first time the tribe had ever deviated from the way of Mother Nature, something that the tribesmen had not felt very comfortable with, but to question their leader (who had been chosen by Mother Nature herself) would have been quite paradoxical and pretty ironic (not that they knew what these words meant, of course).
The father was a man called _______, a young man of twenty three, who had lived a life of dependence. Dependence on rich fat people sitting in far off nations who didn’t waste their food so he could eat. Dependence on people busy collecting small green pieces of paper, most of which went into producing armaments for their nations and a little of which was sent to his village so his people wouldn’t starve to death, and bring forth a new generation to lead a similar life.
He had left his wife with the doctors as she had been crying out in pain due to some complications, and had, for the first time in his life, felt so close to his ancestors, to the spirits that ruled the imaginable universe and the element of life that vibrated through his being and that of Mother Earth. A certain feeling of oneness came over him and he could feel a bug climb his way to the top of a wild shrub, only to be eaten by a chameleon that had been there all the time, just not visible in the leafy vegetation – hidden in plain sight. He no longer thought of himself as a separate being, and the life force percolated through everything around him to form a conscience that was far superior to his own. It was a being in its own right, and was omnipresent and omnipotent.
This was the first time he had ever smoked Hashish.


2.	Derek Ferguson was not what he had been all his life. He had been himself only for the first few months before the process had started – the process that made him who he was and defined how he behaved in society. He had been initiated into a tradition that he was expected to follow to the end of his life – without his consent, and at an age that had denied him a chance to react and retaliate… just like the rest of us.
	But unlike the most of us, at the tender age of sixteen, amid humiliation and bullying that never seemed to end, he had found a vent. This vent had channelled his thoughts in a direction that made him feel what he really was – a god. Everytime he sat in front of his computer and looked at that inviting terminal window, he let himself go. He and his machine were one. It obeyed what he told it to do, although it could be hard to understand at times, and he respected it in return. Respected it for providing him with a world where he was the master, capable of creating new intelligence, managing and looking over his creations, and killing them when they went out of hand. For the world he was a mere computer programmer, but to him, the only world that mattered was the one he had now taken complete control of.
	It intrigued him to think of the manner in which knowledge had been passed on from generation to generation, from civilization to civilization, gaining in mass everytime it came across someone with a brain superior to his peers, and had enabled the wandering cave dweller that had at one time shivered at the sight of lightening to create his own world. This world might not be as large or vivid as the one he had been born in, but he was sure that a day would come when this would be a care of the past.
	One rather normal day at school, while browsing through some files on a computer he shared with many others, he came across a half-written computer program by someone called Sarah Thoburne. It was love at first sight. She was warm, open, and had a positive outlook on life. She believed in unity, freedom, and the right to live and die in peace. She was born to a well-off family that backed her views and would gladly live and let live. She was beautiful and intelligent and confident… but he had never seen her. Five minutes ago, he hadn’t even known that she had ever existed, had never heard her mentioned, and this had been the first time he had ever come across her name.
	And this is how Derek Ferguson had come to peace with his being. To others, he was a mere computer programmer, but he knew much more about them than they did about him – given that they were programmers themselves.


3.	“It’s time.” said the jailer. Rick Foster got up from his bed and, for the last time in his life, turned around with his back towards the bars. He allowed the jailer to put on the cuffs, and made no trouble as the three guards led him out. He looked at his cell for the last time.
Today, he would be set free.
	They led him down the aisle and through the door into a small room that finally opened up into a large field. At a small check-post, he was given all the belongings that he had upon him before being locked up. He was also, with great consideration, given ten dollars to start a new life in the city.
	He walked out of the large steel gate of the prison after changing up, walked up the road a little, and put his case down on the ground. He clutched at his chest and breathed heavily. Faces started to turn. Rick had a severe pain in his chest, difficulty in breathing, and was EVEN frothing at the mouth by now. He was sick. He collapsed on the ground below him, but not before his whole life had flashed before his eyes in a frenzy.
	He was down on the ground with his face against the crude ground and his eyes closed in AGONY. The last thing that crossed his mind was – I see it now.


4.	“Quittin’ already, dawg?” said Troy, and threw a chewed chicken bone at him. Frederick T. walked out of the bar, ignoring all the drunk bastards bursting with laughter. He had a month to go through with ten dollars left. There was no point crying over it though… they would have laughed even if he had won. Like being black wasn’t the biggest mistake in this country.
	It was time to make a harsh move. He went over to his run-down apartment, changed into a black t-shirt and trousers, and fumbled around for his monkey-cap. He opened his drawer and took out the gun from its case. It was dark outside, and he hoped no one would notice. He revved up his bike and sped down the silent road. A teardrop slid down his right cheek, as he took in the madness he was getting himself into.
	It took him an hour to reach the set. All his colleagues were walking around in similar attire, many holding their caps in their hands. He didn’t want to walk in there with his mask off, so he put it on. Fuck these stupid kiddie shows with midgets for burglars.
	“Has anyone seen Freddy?” a high-pitched voice said from somewhere behind him, and he turned around slowly to look at the speaker. It was love at first sight. Not more than five feet away, with a clipboard in hand, stood a Caucasian angel with short blonde hair, eyes as blue as the summer sky, and a stud on his right ear.

5.	Ukapi was hungry, cold, tired, and a little scared. He had run away from his wife, his child, all the sickness, dependence, food, clean water, and everything he had ever cared for.
	Ukapi had died. Not the material, bodily, skin-and-bones Ukapi, but the eternal being that had occupied that body. The eternal, ever-lasting being had died in a way that was unfathomable to the human mind, and had risen again, from its own ethereal ashes. The Ukapi who sat here beneath the cold moonlit darkness, by a drying waterpool in the middle of the forest, amongst shadows spawned by the flickering light of the bonfire, was a different man.
	But in that faint light, just off the shore of the small pond, he could see distinct round shapes hanging from a bush. He went closer to inspect, and rejoiced at the sight. The bush was thick, with broad, elongated leaves, and laden with taste-altering miracle-berries. He plucked a handful, and ate all of them. A smile spread slowly across his face like a big white cloud moves over the sun on a scorching summer noon. He was now ready to eat the scorpion that was cooking over the fire.

6.	“Derek!” A short red-headed boy with freckles and thick glasses could be seen pushing his way through the crowd. He panted for at least half a minute before saying – “You won’t believe what just happened.”
“What?” said Derek, who wasn’t very amused. It wasn’t his fault, actually. Derek was a nice guy, but he had this annoying habit of letting people down. He would raise everyone’s expectations to a level where one would imagine gadgets dropping from heaven, and would then be greeted by a third-grade Chinese toy that would be more frustrating than fun. But that was not the reason why he had a lot of friends. The reason was his twin. She was that hot redhead everyone in town seemed to know.
“You remember Lance?”
Lance was a senior year student who had been hitting on Gail since times immemorial.
“That douche who was hitting on your sister?” said Derek.
Gordon nodded enthusiastically. “He called me over to his place today!”
“So?” Derek stopped. Was Gordon seriously this stupid?
Gordon came a little closer, and said – “There’s going to be weed.”
Derek opened his mouth in shock. Then closed it. This could not be termed as a gasp, as a gasp occurs only once. Derek kept repeating this action like a goldfish.
“You wanna come?” Gordon asked.
They had been thinking of trying the ganja for the past month. Derek had read all he could about it, and had been waiting for the opportunity and the right time.
“Who else will be there?”
“He might have a friend over, but that’s it.”
“I don’t know, man. Never really talked to him.”
“He’s not that bad, actually. Do you really need to think this through? We’ve been talking of doing this since ages.”
“When?” Derek said after a while.
Gordon’s face lit up. Be at my place by six. We’ll go together.

7.	The shelter smelt of humus and petunias. It smelt of rain. It was a small thatched shed in the backyard of a hut. A mother duck was sailing at the pond nearby, with a school of children following her every move. A chicken and a dog were roaming aimlessly around in the vegetation, looking for something to want.
	The gentle breeze added a refreshing hit to the bright morning sun, and brought along with it a spirit of hazy smoke. A woman sat by the door of the small hut on a straw chair, with a pipe in her hands. She looked up at a hawk floating gently up a thermal, and then swerving down over the evergreen canopy of the forest.
	She puffed on her pipe, and let the smoke slowly out her nostrils. Words of a wise man she had once met drifted slowly up her conscience- 
“In having the greatest brain among all animals, man had the smallest mind.”


8. Rick gets into trouble. Only black man to help. Derek chooses to die.  Later, the black guy comes looking for him, and finds him struggling for his life. Saves him. Rick stops being racist.


that there had been a time when none of it was going on—a time when human life was sustained by
hunting and gathering rather than by animal husbandry and agriculture, a time when villages, towns,
and kingdoms were undreamed of, a time when no one made a living as a potter or a basket maker or a
metalworker, a time when trade was an informal and occasional thing, a time when commerce was
unimaginable as a means of livelihood.
We can hardly be surprised that the forgetting took place. On the contrary, it’s hard to imagine how it
could have been avoided. It would have been necessary to hold on to the memory of our hunting-
gathering past for five thousand years before anyone would have been capable of making a written
record of it.
By the time anyone was ready to write the human story, the foundation events of our culture were
ancient, ancient developments—but this didn’t make them unimaginable. On the contrary, they were
quite easy to imagine, simply by extrapolating backward. It was obvious that the kingdoms and
empires of the present were bigger and more populous than those of the past. It was obvious that the
artisans of the present were more knowledgeable and skilled than artisans of the past. It was obvious
that items available for sale and trade were more numerous in the present than in the past. No great feat
of intellect was required to understand that, as one went further and further back in time, the population
(and therefore the towns) would become smaller and smaller, crafts more and more primitive, and
commerce more and more rudimentary. In fact, it was obvious that, if you went back far enough, you
would come to a beginning in which there were no towns, no crafts, and no commerce.
In the absence of any other theory, it seemed reasonable (even inescapable) to suppose that the
human race must have begun with a single human couple, an original man and woman. There was
nothing inherently irrational or improbable about such a supposition. The existence of an original man
and woman didn’t argue for or against an act of divine creation. Maybe that’s just the way things start.
Maybe at the beginning of the world there was one man and one woman, one bull and one cow, one
horse and one mare, one hen and one cock, and so on. Who at this point knew any better? Our cultural
ancestors knew nothing about any agricultural “revolution.” As far as they knew, humans had come
into existence farming, just the way deer had come into existence browsing. As they saw it, agriculture
and civilization were just as innately human as thought or speech. Our hunting-gathering past was not
just forgotten, it was unimaginable.
The Great Forgetting was woven into the fabric of our intellectual life from its very beginning. This
early weaving was accomplished by the nameless scribes of ancient Egypt, Sumer, Assyria, Babylon,
India, and China, then, later, by Moses, Samuel, and Elijah of Israel, by Fabius Pictor and Cato the
Elder of Rome, by Ssu-ma T’an and his son Ssu-ma Ch’ien in China, and, later still, by Hellanicus,
Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xenophon of Greece. (Although Anaximander conjectured that everything
evolved from formless material—what he called “the boundless”—and that Man arose from fishlike
ancestors, he was as unaware of the Great Forgetting as any of the others.) These ancients were the
teachers of Isaiah and Jeremiah, Confucius and Gautama Buddha, Thales and Heraclitus—and these
were the teachers of John the Baptist and Jesus, Lao-tzu and Socrates, Plato and Aristotle—and these
were the teachers of Muhammad and Aquinas and Bacon and Galileo and Newton and Descartes—and
every single one of them unwittingly embodied and ratified the Great Forgetting in their works, so that
every text in history, philosophy, and theology from the origins of literacy to almost the present
moment incorporated it as an integral and unquestioned assumption.
Now I hope—I sincerely hope—that there are many among you who are burning to know why not a
single one of you has ever heard a word about the Great Forgetting (by any name whatsoever) in any
class you have ever attended at any school at any level, from kindergarten to graduate school. If you
have this question, be assured that it’s not an academic one by any means. It’s a vital question, and I
don’t hesitate to say that our species’ future on this planet depends on it.

For resisting the temptation to understand too quickly. For resisting the temptation to grab onto
something, even if it wasn’t what he was saying.”
“Wow,” I said. “What a fabulous thing to be good at.”
- 58 -
“Don’t knock it, Jared—and I’ll try not to knock it either. But where it kills you is in dealing with
someone like Fr. Lulfre. You think pawn to queen four is a brilliant first move, but while you’re
shoving up that pawn, he’s bringing out both knights, both bishops, and has castled. He’s always eight
moves ahead of you.”
“How does Fr. Lulfre come into this?”
“He comes into this by way of you, of course. He dropped you into this action two weeks ago and
can pull you out whenever he pleases.” She cocked her head to one side. “Unless you’re ready to walk
away from your vocation.”
“I’m not.”
“Then here’s what you have to face right now: Fr. Lulfre knows you at least as well as I do. This
means that, consciously or unconsciously, he chose you because you won’t leap ahead to conclusions
he wants to reserve to himself.”
“Now I have an inkling,” I said, “of how a retarded person must feel when he finally realizes that he
is retarded.”
“Don’t be ridiculous.”
“I have a question I’ve no business asking but that I’m going to ask anyway. What was your
relationship with Charles?”
She gave me a frozen look, which I returned. “You didn’t dare to ask Charles that.”
“That’s right.”
“But you dare to ask me. Why?”
“Because you’re the one I want to hear it from.”
“Why is that?” she demanded, glaring.
“If Fr. Lulfre is eight moves ahead of me, then you must be at least four moves ahead, in which case
you already know why. I’m still at move one, trying to figure it out.”
B gave me a long look in an effort to sort through this mess. I’m not sure whether it was beyond her
or she just decided to pretend it was beyond her. In any case, she said, “B and I were not lovers.”
“I see. Nothing to add to that?”
“We were exactly what you saw. What part of that do you need to have explained?”
“None of it,” I said. “I just didn’t realize I was in the presence of a miracle. Friendships like yours
are one in a billion. You were damned lucky—the two of you.”
She sat through a full minute like a rock, refusing to let me see the tears welling up in her eyes, and
if I’d been foolish enough to say a word or reach out a hand, she probably would have flattened me. At
the end of it, she brushed the tears away, not minding my seeing her do that, because it was over.
“Characteristically,” I said, “I don’t know what’s going on. What are we doing here?”
“I’m picking up your education where Charles left it off.”
I stared at her for a while then asked why she would do that. “I know why Charles would do it, I just
don’t understand why you would do it.”
“You probably won’t like this answer,” she said after a moment’s thought, “but it’s the only one I
have. You see this education as a favor we’re doing you, not as a necessity. We see it as a necessity
because we’re playing four moves ahead of you. Can you accept that?”
“I guess I have to.”
“As soon as you catch up, you’ll see the necessity for it yourself. You won’t be in any doubt about
it.”
“You’re right,” I said. “I don’t like that answer.”
Defending the gap
“When Charles started, we thought we had weeks. With his assassination, I now think we have days,
maybe hours.”
I asked her what Charles’s death had to do with it, but she just shook her head and went on.
“Charles’s approach had to be his own, of course, but to be honest, I thought it was too cerebral and too
circuitous. I have to begin at a more elemental level.”
“Okay,” I said doubtfully. Then: “Are you talking about starting right this second?”
- 59 -
“Do you have another appointment?”
“No, of course not.”
“If you’re waiting for me to go into mourning for a month, that just can’t happen. Not now. Not in
these circumstances.”
“I’m sorry, go on.”
“Charles didn’t want to carry you across the gap, Jared. He wanted you to leap across it yourself,
that’s why he proceeded as he did. Do you know what I’m talking about?”
“Are you talking about the leap I have to make to reach the conclusion he wanted me to reach?”
“That’s right. Every sentence he spoke was designed to extend the road for you by a centimeter. He
was closing the gap pebble by pebble, hoping you’d eventually make the leap by yourself.”
“But I never did.”
“You never did. I don’t have the patience to follow that procedure, Jared—the patience or the time.
I’m going to throw you across the gap. I’m going to start with the conclusion.”
She waited for me to respond, and I guess I could have said okay or “That sounds swell,” but it
didn’t sound either okay or swell to me. To me it sounded like the end . . . which is of course exactly
what a conclusion is.
“Okay,” I said. “That sounds swell.”
She gave me a doubtful look, as if she didn’t any more believe me than I did. Then she went on:
“Here is something I want you to tell me, Jared. You’re a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. You
understand what the ministry of Jesus was all about, don’t you?”
“Yes, I think so.”
“Do you or don’t you?”
“I understand it.”
“Tell me in three words what Jesus came to do.”
“In three words?”
“You tell me or I’ll tell you. In three words, what did Jesus come to do?”
“To save souls.”
“That isn’t just the Roman Catholic take, is it? You could carry that around to every Christian
denomination there is, and they’d all sign off on it, wouldn’t they?”
“Yes, I think so. That’s probably the only statement they all would sign off on.”
“He didn’t come to save the whales, did he?”
“No.”
“He didn’t come to save old-growth forests or wetlands, did he?”
“No.”
“Now tell me what you think we’re doing here, Jared. What is this all about?”
“What do you mean by ‘this’?”
“I’ll say it a different way. We know what Jesus came to do. What did B come to do?”
“I don’t know,” I said, alarmed.
“You do know, Jared. What is the subject of our conversations here? What is the subject of all our
talks?”
I shook my head.
“Take the leap now, Jared. The gap’s about two inches wide. Three words will bridge it.”
I stared at her, frozen solid.
“Speak, goddammit. Don’t make me say this for you. What’s the subject of all our conversations?
What’s the subject of all our talks?”
I managed to get it out as a hoarse croak: “Saving the world.”
“Saving the world—of course. It was right there in front of your nose the whole time, wasn’t it.
Now, Jared, we are goddamn well going to get to the Antichrist. Right now. Okay?”
“Okay.”
“That’s what you’re here about, isn’t it?”
“Yes.”
“Now, in the history of the Antichrist, it was always understood that he would be the inversion of the
Christ. If the Christ came for the salvation of souls, then the Antichrist would come . . .”
- 60 -
“For the damnation of souls.”
“Absolutely. If the Christ preached good works and perfection, then the Antichrist would preach . . .”
“Sin and wickedness.”
“That’s how it’s been traditionally understood. But, as I understood what you told us, more
theologically sophisticated thinkers have moved beyond that traditional understanding. They already
realize that, if the prophecies about the Antichrist are to be taken seriously, then they won’t be fulfilled
by someone preaching sin and wickedness—not in this day and age. What sins and wickedness could
any preacher possibly come up with that wouldn’t evoke yawns of utter boredom from an audience of
modern television viewers?”
“None,” I agreed.
“The traditional Antichrist as preacher of sin and wickedness wouldn’t even make a ripple in the
modern world, therefore . . .”
“Therefore?”
“Think, Jared. If a preacher of sin and wickedness wouldn’t make it as the Antichrist, then . . .”
“Then the Antichrist is going to be something else.”
“Then the Antichrist is going to be an inversion of Christ in a different direction.”
She clearly wanted a reaction from me at this point, so I said, “I see that. The Antichrist is going to
be an inversion of Christ in a different direction.”
“What other direction?”
“I don’t know.” I really didn’t.
“Come on, Jared. The gap is three inches wide.”
I shook my head.
“We’ll go through it again,” she said. “Christ’s ministry is . . .”
“Saving souls.”
“But saving souls isn’t B’s ministry, is it?”
“No,” I said.
“B’s ministry is saving the world.”
“No,” I said again stubbornly refusing to see the light.
“You mean yes, Jared. This is the inversion Fr. Lulfre sees. Not saving souls inverted to damning
souls but rather saving souls inverted to saving the world. This is why you were sent. This is what
makes B a candidate.”
“No!”
“Why do you say no? Charles told you again and again that you would eventually understand why
people were calling him the Antichrist. This is what he was talking about.”
“I say no because, if trying to save the world makes you the Antichrist, then Greenpeace is the
Antichrist, Earth First is the Antichrist, the Nature Conservancy is the Antichrist, the World Wildlife
Fund is the Antichrist.”
“Jared, these organizations aren’t up to the same thing as B. They aren’t up to anything remotely like
the same thing. You know that.”
“I don’t know that.”
She produced an exasperated little laugh. “You’re a wonder, Jared, you really are. For you, a three-
inch gap might as well be the Grand Canyon.”
A hazardous walk
“I am B,” Shirin said, “but I’m not an experienced teacher. Having announced that I wasn’t going to
follow Charles’s practice of trying to goad you across gaps, I immediately set about trying to goad you
across a gap.” She paused and looked around doubtfully at our strange, palatially seedy theatrical
cavern. “I think we should get out of here, to begin with—break the pattern.”
I agreed, and we left.
“Do you mind walking?” she asked.
“Not at all, provided we’re not heading for Little Bohemia.”
She smiled. “That was Charles’s hangout, not mine. There’s a little park a couple miles away that
- 61 -
might be helpful.”
I wondered why a park might be “helpful” but said that would be fine. We walked through the long
twilight.
Back home, I never take long walks with beautiful women on pleasant spring evenings. That would
not be thought well of, and I’m not exactly crazy.
It occurs to me to say that I’ve often wished someone would write a useful book about the real life of
Roman Catholic priests. I wish for this not because such a book might include things I do know but
because it might include things I don’t know. It’s my distinct impression that priests have more fucked-
up love affairs than any other group of people on earth, including high-school kids and movie stars.
And these are not great, soaring forbidden romances in the manner of The Thorn Birds. These are
really dumb, incompetent, bruising debacles, because, by the very nature of things, priests have almost
no chance to learn from experience in the normal way. (One thing the book would definitely have to
cover is the utterly laughable idea that priests learn all about life in the confessional.)
Let me rush to note right here that I don’t speak of fucked-up love affairs from personal experience.
If I’ve avoided romantic entanglements, it’s not because I’m noble and dedicated, it’s for exactly the
same reasons I’ve avoided skydiving, hang gliding, and street luging. The invitations to entangle are
plentiful, ranging from the open to the barely discernible, not just for me but for all priests. It’s partly
that women imagine we’re safe (will not get all demanding and tiresome), partly that they perceive us
as a sexual challenge, and partly that they confuse us with the role we play. We’re trained to be,
expected to be, and even paid to be attentive, sensitive, understanding, wise, and authoritative, and this
is a turn-on for a lot of women—what the hell, a lot of men too.
Another thing this book would point out is that vows are vows, and the priestly kind are neither more
nor less serious than the marriage kind. Married folks don’t usually go all to pieces if they happen to
break their vows, and to tell the naked truth, neither do priests—except in fiction. In fiction, having an
affair presents a priest with a life-shattering crisis of conscience; in real life, having an affair usually
just presents him with a hell of a mess. Again, I speak from observation of colleagues, not from
personal experience. So far.
I thought about these things as I walked through the pleasant spring evening with a beautiful woman
at my side. Far from home, where I would never dream of doing such a thing.
It was borne in on me: I’m not made of iron.
I said, “How do you happen to know sign language?”
“My parents were deaf.”
This was not much of a conversation, I thought, to be having in these romantic circumstances.
Leaden-footed, I droned on: “Is it the same in America and Germany?”
“No, actually it isn’t.”
I plodded on. “When you were signing on the stage with Charles, did you know whether anyone in
the audience would understand you?”
“No. And if you’re planning to ask why I bothered, the answer is that it’s something I was doing for
myself. It’s a different language.”
“I know that, but what’s that got to do with it?”
“When you’re signing, you have to think very differently. Very, very differently.” We walked in
silence for a bit. “It’s hard to explain to someone who doesn’t know the language,” she added finally.
“Translating into sign isn’t like translating into another spoken language. You have to rethink it very
fundamentally.”
“Charles could sign?”
“He could understand a lot, but he couldn’t sign a lot.” From a corner of my eye, I saw a small smile
edge onto her lips. “But when he did sign, he had a wonderful style, all his own.”
My stomach sank under a tarry load of jealousy. I knew I was in big trouble here.
Borders
Shirin’s “small park” seemed pretty big to me, in the gathering darkness. I don’t know whether it
was a park that had gone to seed or had been designed that way, as a miniature wilderness with sketchy
- 62 -
paths, no lights, and an occasional bench. I’m not an expert on parks or on wildernesses. We trekked on
for ten minutes or so, then settled on a bench. With the trees blocking out what little light was left in
the sky, it might as well have been midnight.
“Borders are always tricky, intriguing things,” B said at last. “Feral children fascinate because they
stand at the border of the animal world. Gorillas and dolphins fascinate because they stand at the
border of the human world. Even though they’re only arbitrary consequences of the fact that we use a
decimal numeration system, the borders between centuries and millennia fascinate. Shakespeare’s fools
fascinate because they live at the border between sanity and madness. The heroes of tragedy fascinate
because they walk the border between triumph and defeat. The borders between prehuman and human,
between childhood and adulthood, between generations, between nations and peoples, between social
and political paradigms—all of these are intensely fascinating.
“The border that Charles and I have been trying to focus your attention on is the border that was
crossed when one group of people living in the Fertile Crescent ten thousand years ago became us. You
know that crossing this border brought us to a very special sort of agriculture that produces enormous
food surpluses. You know that crossing this border brought us to the most laborious lifestyle ever
practiced on this planet. But these are superficial perceptions. Charles wanted you to see that this
border represents a profoundly important spiritual and mental crossing. Charles tried to lead you to an
appreciation of this crossing by leading you back to it from this side, from the present moment, but I’m
going to take the opposite tack. I’ll try to lead you to an appreciation of this crossing by leading you
forward to it from the other side, from our origins in the community of life.”
I felt rather than saw her shiver. I think she must have felt my question in turn, for she said, “I’m not
cold, I’m terrified.”
“Why?”
“Charles could have done this—would have done this next. But he hoped he wouldn’t have to. This
is so much more . . . difficult.”
The words I’m sorry were halfway out of my mouth, but I managed to hold them back.
B stared into space for a few minutes, then said, “The fundamental Taker delusion is that humanity
itself was designed—and therefore destined—to become us. This is a twin of the idea that the entire
universe was created in order to produce this planet. We would smile patronizingly if the Gebusi
boasted that humanity was divinely destined to become Gebusi, but we’re perfectly satisfied that
humanity was divinely destined to become us.”
“I think I’m beginning to see that, though I certainly didn’t see it the first time Charles said We are
not humanity.”
B nodded distantly, as if holding on to a tenuous thought. “Because we imagine that we are what
humanity was divinely destined to become, we assume that our prehistoric ancestors were trying to be
us but just lacked the tools and techniques to succeed. We invest our ancestors with our own
predelictions in what seem to us primitive and unevolved forms. As an example of all this, we take it
for granted that our religions represent humanity’s ultimate and highest spiritual development and
expect to find among our ancestors only crude, fumbling harbingers of these religions. We certainly
don’t expect to find robust, fully developed religions whose expressions are entirely different from
ours.”
“Very true, I said.
“To what development do we trace the beginnings of human religious thought?”
“I’d say we trace the beginnings of human religious thought to the practice of burying the dead,
which began thirty or forty thousand years ago.”
B nodded. “This is just like tracing the beginning of human language to the practice of writing,
which began about five thousand years ago.”
“I see what you mean—I think.”
“It would never occur to a linguist to search for the origins of human language in the clay tablets of
Mesopotamia, would it?”
“Certainly not,” I said.
“Where would a linguist search for the origins of human language?”
“I think he’d go back to the origins of human life itself.”
- 63 -
“Because to be human is to have language.”
“I’d say so.”
“If Homo habilis didn’t have language, then he’s misnamed—doesn’t deserve to be called Homo.”
“I would say so.”
“What is our hypothetical linguist’s method going to be?”
“I’d say it’s going to be more philosophical and speculative than linguistic. He doesn’t have an early
human specimen whose language can be studied.”
“He’s going to be puttering around in one of those fascinating borderlands. On one side of the
border, manlike creatures without language—tool-using (as even modern chimpanzees are), but lacking
what we mean by language. On the other side of the border, people.”
“That’s right,” I said.
“But he’s not going to study any clay tablets.”
“No, not even for a minute.”
“Good, because I don’t intend to spend even a minute on the burial practices of the Upper
Paleolithic. They’re as irrelevant to the origins of religion as clay tablets are to the origins of
language.”
“I understand.”
Bricolage
“The linguist and I must both practice bricolage, which is the craft of building with whatever comes
to hand. It comes from the French bricoler, to putter about. We must both putter about in this strange
borderland inhabited by almost-humans on one side and truly-humans on the other.”
“So you assume that being human means being religious, just as the linguist assumes that being
human means being lingual.”
“Being a bricoleur, I don’t do anything as well defined as that, Jared. I poke around. I wonder if
there’s a dimension of thought that is inherently religious. I say to myself that perhaps thought is like a
musical tone, which (in nature) is never a single, pure tone but is always a composite of many
harmonics—overtones and undertones. And I say to myself that perhaps, when mental process became
human thought, it began to resound with one harmonic that corresponds to what we call religion, or,
more fundamentally, awareness of the sacred. In other words, I wonder if awareness of the sacred is not
so much a separate concept as it is an overtone of human thought itself. A conjecture of this sort can
yield scientia, knowledge, but since it isn’t falsifiable, it can’t yield science in the modern sense. A
work of bricolage is never science, Jared, but it can still astound, make sense, and stimulate thought. It
can still impress with its veracity, validity, soundness, and cogency.”
“I see.” It seemed to me that, in all this talk, she was somehow trying to “screw her courage to the
sticking-place.” I didn’t know why this was necessary or how to help, so I just kept nodding and
saying, “I see, I see.”
Finally she lifted her eyes to the trees overhead and said, “The moon is up.” As if this were a signal,
she got up and led me off the path into the woods. Several times in the next few minutes she paused to
look around (at what, I don’t know), then moved on. Now and then she stopped to pick up something
found in the grass. At last she came to a clearing that suited her, and we sat down.
She showed me the things she’d collected on the way—a nail, an old cartridge fuse, a 35mm film
canister, a paper clip, a plastic comb, an acorn. At her request, I showed her what I had in my pockets,
and she chose a key and a pen to add to the collection.
“This is what the universe has supplied me with tonight, Jared. We’ll have to see what I can make
with it.”
Suddenly I remembered the fossil ammonite in my jacket pocket. She looked at it with evident
surprise when I handed it to her, and I explained that Charles had given it to me to hold on to till we
got around to it (which we never had).
“This will be the centerpiece of our work of bricolage,” she said, putting it down between us.
“Charles had a different purpose in mind for it—I’m pretty sure I know what it was, and we’ll get
around to that as well—but meanwhile it’ll serve as the piece to which all other pieces in our work
- 64 -
must cling. It’s the community of life on this planet.”
“Okay.”
“A few minutes ago I said that perhaps, when mental process became human thought, it began to
resound with one harmonic that corresponds to what we call religion or awareness of the sacred.”
“I remember.”
“I want you to think of this shell as the community of life. I want you to think that if you know just
how to listen to it, this shell will ring out with that harmonic. Can you do that?”
“I can try.”
Animism
“There once was a universal religion on this planet, Jared,” B said. “Were you aware of that?”
I said I wasn’t.
“Audiences are almost always amazed by this news. Occasionally someone will think I’m referring
to what is sometimes called the ‘Old Religion’—paganism, Wicca—but of course I’m not. In the first
place, paganism isn’t old. It’s a farmer’s religion through and through, which means it’s just a few
thousand years old, and of course it was never a universal religion, for the simple reason that farming
was never universal. Very often—almost invariably, in fact—no one will even recognize the name of
the religion I’m talking about, which of course is animism. They’ve literally never heard of it.”
“I can believe it,” I said.
“Do you know animism?”
“I think you’d better assume I don’t. Most people in my position, with my training, are aware of
animism the way modern-day chemists are aware of alchemy.”
“You mean you’re aware of animism as a crude and simpleminded precursor of religion the way
chemists are aware of alchemy as a crude and simpleminded precursor of chemistry. Not really religion
in the proper sense any more than alchemy is chemistry in the proper sense.”
“That’s right.”
She pawed through her collection of oddments and selected the film canister. “This is animism,” she
said, holding it up for my consideration. “An empty container as far as you’re concerned.” Then she
dived into her purse and came up with a traveler’s sewing kit, from which she extracted a bit of thread
long enough to bind film canister and ammonite together.
“Here, hold on to this,” she said, and I took it from her. “Tell me about the shell.”
“What do you mean?”
“What is it?”
“Oh,” I said. “It’s the community of life on this planet.”
“And what did I just say to you about it?”
“You said that when mental process became human thought, perhaps this community began to
resound with one harmonic that corresponds to what we call religion or awareness of the sacred. If I
learn how to listen to it, it’ll ring out with that harmonic.”
“Good. But it occurs to me that I’ve introduced a puzzle here. I said that when mental process (a
common phenomenon in the animal kingdom) became human thought, it began to ring out with a
harmonic that I’ve identified as awareness of the sacred. But now I’m saying that the community of life
rings with that harmonic. Which is it, human thought or the community of life?”
“I don’t find this too puzzling,” I told her. “I think the community of life began to ring with that
harmonic when human thought began to ring with it.”
“Yes, that’s what I had in mind. And when this shell begins to resonate with that harmonic, this
hollow canister that I’ve called animism will also begin to resonate, because it’s in contact with the
shell.”
“Okay,” I said. “This is what you mean by bricolage?”
“This is what I mean by bricolage.”

Regarding the number of the gods
“Someone inevitably asks why I speak of gods rather than one God, as if I simply hadn’t been
informed on this matter and was speaking in error, and I ask them how they happen to know the
number of the gods. Sometimes I’m told this is just something ‘everyone’ knows, the way everyone
knows there are twenty-four hours in a day. Sometimes I’m told God must be one, because this seems
to us the most ‘enlightened’ number for God to be—as if the facts don’t count in this particular case.
This is like reasoning that the earth must be the center of the universe, because no other place makes as
much sense. Most often, of course, I’m told this is an undoubtable number, since it’s the number given
in monotheistic scriptures. Needless to say, I have a rather different take on the whole matter.
“The number of the gods is written nowhere in the universe, Jared, so there’s really no way to decide
whether that number is zero (as atheists believe) or one (as monotheists believe) or many (as
polytheists believe). The matter is one of complete indifference to me. I don’t care whether the number
of the gods is one, zero, or nine billion. If it turned out that the number of the gods is zero, this
wouldn’t cause me to alter a single syllable of what I’ve said to you.”
She seemed to want a reaction to this, so I said okay.
“To speak of gods instead of God has this additional advantage, that I’m spared the embarrassing
necessity of forever playing stupid gender games with them. I never have to decide between he and
she, him and her. For me, they’re just they and them.”
“A not inconsiderable advantage,” I observed.
She picked up the plastic comb and ran a thumbnail down its teeth. “Is it one thing or many?”
“You mean the comb? I don’t know. Depends on how you look at it.”
“This comb is the number of the gods, Jared. Not something to be added to our work of bricolage,
but rather something to be discussed and dismissed.” She tossed the comb over her shoulder and out of
sight.
Where the gods write what they write
“The God of revealed religions—and by this I mean religions like yours, Taker religions—is a
profoundly inarticulate God. No matter how many times he tries, he can’t make himself clearly or
completely understood. He speaks for centuries to the Jews but fails to make himself understood. At
last he sends his only-begotten son, and his son can’t seem to do any better. Jesus might have sat
himself down with a scribe and dictated the answers to every conceivable theological question in
absolutely unequivocal terms, but he chose not to, leaving subsequent generations to settle what Jesus
had in mind with pogroms, purges, persecutions, wars, the burning stake, and the rack. Having failed
through Jesus, God next tried to make himself understood through Muhammad, with limited success,
as always. After a thousand years of silence he tried again with Joseph Smith, with no better results.
Averaging it out, all God has been able to tell us for sure is that we should do unto others as we’d have
them do unto us. What’s that—a dozen words? Not much to show for five thousand years of work, and
we probably could have figured out that much for ourselves anyway. To be honest, I’d be embarrassed
to be associated with a god as incompetent as that.”
“Your gods have done better?”
“Good heavens, yes, Jared. Immeasurably better—infinitely better! Just look out there!” She waved
her hand at the world in front of us. “What do you see?”
“I see the universe.”
“That’s it, Jared. That’s where the real gods of the universe write what they write. Your God writes
in words. The gods I’m talking about write in galaxies and star systems and planets and oceans and
forests and whales and birds and gnats.”
“And what do they write?”
“Well, they write physics and chemistry and biology and astronomy and aerodynamics and
meteorology and geology—all that, of course, but that isn’t what you’re after, is it?”
“No.”
“What are you after?”
- 66 -
“I’m after . . . what the gods have to write about us.”
B grabbed my pen and held it up. “This is what you’re after. This is the Law of Life.”
She picked up the ammonite fossil and slipped the pen under the thread that held the film canister in
place. “What’s this?” she asked, pointing to the fossil.
“The community of life on this planet.
“And this?”—pointing to the canister.
“Animism.”
“And you see that the Law of Life is nestled in between the two, touching both the community of
life and animism.”
“What is the Law of Life?” I asked her.
“We’ll get to that. That’s our main subject tonight.”
Science vs. religion
“Religions like yours, revealed religions, are all perceived to be at odds with scientific knowledge—
at odds with or irrelevant to. I wonder if you see why.”
“I think it’s come to be seen that religion and science are just inherently incompatible.”
B nodded. “Following the usual Taker pattern: ‘We are humanity, so if our religions are inherently
incompatible with scientific knowledge, then religion itself must be inherently incompatible with
scientific knowledge.’ ”
“That’s right.”
“But as you’ll see, animism is perfectly at home with scientific knowledge. It’s much more at home
with your sciences than with your religions.”
“Why is that?”
“What’s that out there?” she asked, making her usual sweeping gesture.
“That’s the world, the universe.”
“That’s where the real gods of the universe write what they write, Jared. The gods of your revealed
religions write in books.”
“What does that have to do with animism?”
“Animism looks for truth in the universe, not in books, revelations, and authorities. Science is the
same. Though animism and science read the universe in different ways, both have complete confidence
in its truthfulness.”
She poked around among her building blocks, picked out the cartridge fuse, and held it up for my
inspection. “This is science,” she said. “Religions like yours, Jared, are skeptical about it, are afraid to
use it. They say, ‘Suppose we use it and it blows up in our face! Better not trust it.’ But animism isn’t
worried about anything that can be revealed about the universe, so science belongs right here beside
it.” She slid the fuse under the thread holding the film canister to the fossil. Then she asked me to
describe what I saw.
I said, “Animism is flanked by the Law of Life on one side and by science on the other. All three
face the community of life.”
The border
“Now I want to make sure we don’t lose track of what we set out to do here, Jared. We’re
investigating a border between almost-humans on one side and truly-humans on the other. We’re doing
this because it’s my notion that we came to humanity as religious beings.”
“Okay.”
“Let’s extend our bricolage to include a little mental landscaping of the area around us. Take a stick
and draw a circle around us at a distance of a couple paces.”
I did as she asked and sat down again.
“That circle represents the border we’re investigating, about three million years in the past, when
Australopithecus became Homo. Is that clear?”
I said it was.
- 67 -
“I’m sure you understand that this line is imaginary. There was never a day when you would’ve been
able to point to one generation of parents and say, ‘These are Australopithecines,’ then point to their
children and say, ‘These are humans.’
“I understand.”
“We can’t know how wide the line itself is. It might be two hundred years wide or a thousand years
wide or ten thousand years wide. All we know is that on our side of the line there are creatures we feel
confident about calling Homo and on the far side of the line there are creatures we don’t feel confident
about calling Homo.”
“I understand.”
“I don’t know how much you know about all this, so I’ll play it safe and point out that the line
doesn’t correspond to tool use. I mean, you don’t have users of tools on this side of the line and
nonusers on the far side. You have tool-users on both sides of the line. We can be virtually certain of
this, since even chimpanzees are well known tool-users, and Homo’s immediate predecessors were far
beyond chimpanzees.”
I told her I knew all this but didn’t mind her “playing it safe.”
The Law of Life: the hologram
B asked me to describe the state of our work of bricolage. I picked it up and studied it again before
beginning. “This fossil shell is the community of life on this planet. The religion you call animism is
bound up with this community. Something called the Law of Life is written in the community of life
and this too is bound up with animism. Perhaps it’s the work of animism to read the Law of Life that is
written in the community of life.”
“That’s an excellent guess, Jared. Go on.”
“Animism perceives itself as allied with science, because both seek truth in the universe itself.”
“Good. Now we’re ready to spend some time on the Law of Life. The Law of Life is like a
hologram. Do you know anything about holography?”
“A bit. I was a photography buff in high school, and holography is basically lensless photography. In
ordinary photography, a photographic plate is exposed to light reflected from an object, and an image
appears on the plate because a lens intervenes. In holography, a photographic plate is exposed to light
reflected from an object, but no image appears on the plate because no lens intervenes. What’s
recorded on the plate are patterns of light waves received from every part of the photographed object.
This is the hologram. And when the hologram is placed in a beam of light, a three-dimensional image
of the photographed object appears in midair where the original object stood. And because every part
of it is imprinted with light waves from the whole object, any fragment of the hologram can be used to
regenerate the whole image.”
“This is how the Law of Life is similar to a hologram, Jared: Every fragment of it is imprinted with
the whole law.”
“The Law of Life is what governs life?”
“No, the Law of Life isn’t what governs life, it’s what fosters life, and anything that fosters life
belongs to the law.”
I told her an example would help.
“Here’s the Law of Life for newly hatched ducklings: Latch on to the first thing you see that moves,
and follow it no matter what. Since the first thing newly hatched ducklings see is ordinarily their
mother, they usually latch on to their mother, but they’ll latch on to anything that moves. Since their
best hope for survival is latching on to their mother, no matter what, you can see why this is the law
that fosters life for ducklings.”
“Yes, I can see that.”
“Here’s a generalization that can be made about the Law of Life: Those who follow it tend to
become better represented in the gene pool of their species than those who don’t follow it.”
“So not all individuals follow the law?”
“The duckling that for one reason or another doesn’t receive or respond to the genetic latching-on-
to-mom signal is weeded out. It doesn’t survive long enough to reproduce.”
- 68 -
“I see.”
“Obviously the law varies in its details from species to species. In ducks, the law is written for
ducklings and it reads, ‘Stick to mom no matter what.’ In goats, the law is written for the mother, and it
reads, ‘Suckle only your own.‘”
I thought about that for a bit and asked how “Suckle only your own” fosters life for goats.
“Let’s say White Goat and Black Goat each have a suckling kid. Black Goat dies, so her kid comes
over to White Goat and says, ‘Hey, I’m hungry, how about some lunch?’ The best chance White Goat’s
kid has for survival is if its mother says to this stranger, ‘Get lost, kid, you’re not mine.’ If White Goat
says, ‘Okay, sure, pull up a teat,’ she’ll be diminishing her own kid’s chance for survival—which
means her own genes’ chance for survival.”
“Yes, I can see that.”
“Here’s a more general statement of the law as it’s followed by goats: ‘If your resources are of
doubtful sufficiency for two offspring, then you’re better off giving all to one than half to each.’ ”
“Not the law of kindness.”
“I would say rather, ‘Not the law of futile kindness.’ I think most mothers would rather have one live
child than any number of dead ones. Nonetheless, it’s certainly true that, if the two are in conflict, the
law favors life over kindness. Those who follow the contrary law—the law that favors kindness over
life—will tend to lose their representation in the gene pool of their species. This is because their
offspring will tend to survive and reproduce less often than the offspring of those who follow the law
that favors life.”
“I understand.”
“On the subject of kindness . . . I don’t know if you know David Brower—one of the century’s
foremost environmentalists, the founder of the John Muir Institute, Friends of the Earth, and Earth
Island Institute. He tells this story of one of his earliest adventures as a naturalist. At the age of eleven
he collected some eggs of the western swallowtail butterfly and kept an eye on them as they hatched
into caterpillars, which later turned into chrysalides. Finally the first of the chrysalides began to crack
open, and what Brower saw was this: The emerging butterfly struggled out, its abdomen distended by
some sort of fluid that was pumped out over its wings as it hung upside down on a twig. Half an hour
later it was ready to fly, and it took off. As the other chrysalides began to crack, however, Brower
decided to make himself useful. He gently eased open the crack to facilitate the butterflies’ emergence,
and they promptly slid out, walked around, and one by one dropped dead. He had failed to realize that
the exertions he had spared the butterflies were essential to their survival, because they triggered the
flow of fluid that had to reach their wings. This experience taught him a lesson he was still talking
about seventy years later: What appears to be kind and is meant to be kind can be the reverse of kind.”
“I understand.”
“Among goats, it’s the mother that enforces this law: ‘If your resources are of doubtful sufficiency
for two, then you’re better off giving all to one than half to each.’ Among eagles (and many other bird
species), it’s enforced by the elder of the two offspring. The female will typically produce two eggs a
few days apart, which is naturally better survival policy than producing a single egg. But if the first
chick survives, it will almost invariably peck or starve the younger chick to death.”
I said, “I guess it was my impression that infanticide was explained as a reaction to overcrowding.”
“Yes, it used to be explained that way, but this argues a perception of evolution that ultimately didn’t
stand up to close examination—a perception of evolution as promoting what’s ‘good for the species.’ It
now seems clear that evolution promotes what’s good for the individual, in the sense of assuring the
individual’s reproductive success—what I’ve been calling ‘representation in the gene pool.’
“I see.”
“In lions and bears, females will often abandon a litter that has only one survivor—even if this one
survivor is in perfect health. This isn’t ‘good for the species’ in any way, but it’s good for the
individual’s lifetime reproductive success. Her representation in the gene pool will definitely improve
if she invests exclusively in litters larger than one.”
“I have to admit that this is all news to me.”
“No one can know everything,” she said with a shrug.
“Show me where we’re going here. I’m feeling lost again.”
- 69 -
“I can’t teach you the whole of the Law of Life in a single night, Jared. I couldn’t teach you the
whole of it if we came here every night for a decade. What I can do in a single night is present you
with a few pieces of it, in the manner of a bricoleur. But let’s reach for some pieces in a new direction.”
The Law of Life: a mouse burial
She stood up, and I started to follow her example, but she told me to stay put. “Let’s see if I’m lucky
tonight,” she said, and ducked into the underbrush straight ahead of us, clearly the huntress in search of
a scent. I closed my eyes, grateful for the break. Returning after ten or fifteen minutes from the right,
she beckoned me to follow her, which I did with some apprehension. I don’t know whether it’s a guy
thing or a people thing, but I don’t like being made to feel like a greenhorn, as I suspected I was going
to be. Not more than ten paces in, she stopped, crouched, and invited me to inspect a bare patch of
ground the size of a checkerboard. I identified it at a glance: “Dirt.”
She shook her head impatiently and picked up a twig, which she used as a pointer, showing me
something here, there, and everywhere. Looking closely, I spotted clumps of dry grass, twig parts, bits
of bark, broken leaves, and more dirt.
“Don’t do this to me,” I told her. “I’m not Natty Bumppo and never will be.”
She didn’t argue. Instead, she reached her twig over to raise a branch of a low bush and invited me
to have a look under it. What it looked like was a dead mouse being buried like a bather at the beach.
Only its head showed, nestled in a little mound of dirt. As I watched, in the dimmest possible light, the
ruffle of dirt around its neck bubbled here and there, and the mouse visibly slid back a millimeter, as if
literally sinking into the earth.
“In an hour or so,” B explained, “the mouse will be completely underground and out of sight, the
work of burying beetles that are digging the soil out from under it.”
She lowered the branch, and I asked what she’d been trying to show me in the dirt in front of the
bush. She used her twig as a pointer as she tried to show me the signs. “The beetles—I’m pretty sure
there are just two of them—found the mouse’s carcass here but evidently didn’t care for this as a burial
site, so they carried it to a more sheltered site under that branch.”
“Two beetles carried the mouse?”
“What they do is burrow under the carcass then turn over onto their backs and shove it in the
direction they want it to go. It’s a very laborious process. Once they have it underground, they harden
the chamber around it, and while the corpse rots, the female lays her eggs nearby so the larvae will
have easy access to the carrion mass once it’s opened up.”
“Yum,” I said.
“Oh, there’s plenty of competition for this mouse, Jared—other insects, microbes, many vertebrate
scavengers. The flies are especially bothersome, because they may have laid their eggs in the mouse’s
fur before the beetles came along. Fortunately—but not surprisingly—the beetles themselves are
supplied with egg-sweepers, mites that make their homes right on the beetles and that live on flies’
eggs. The mouse, the beetles, the mites, and the flies are all inspiring embodiments of the Law of
Life.”
I thought about this last statement as we made our way back to the clearing. “I’m afraid I don’t see
what makes these creatures embodiments of the law,” I told her.
“The Law of Life in a single word is: abundance.” When no more was forthcoming, I asked if she’d
elaborate on that a bit.
“A useful exercise would be for you to go back to the mouse carcass and bring back one of the
beetles. Then I’d have you pick off a couple dozen of the beetle’s phoretic mites so you could examine
them under a microscope.”
“What would I learn from that?”
“You’d learn that each mite—such an inconsiderable creature!—is a work of so much delicacy,
perfection, and complexity that it makes a digital computer look like a pair of pliers. Then you’d learn
something even more amazing, that, for all their perfection, they aren’t stamped out of a mold. No two
of them are alike—no two in all the mighty universe, Jared!”
“And this would be a demonstration of . . . abundance?”

“That’s right. This fantastic genetic abundance is life’s very secret of success on this planet.”
We trooped on. After a few minutes I realized we’d left our clearing far behind. Before long we were
back on the public paths.
B said, “I haven’t done nearly as well as I thought I would tonight, Jared. I haven’t shown you a
tenth as much as I hoped. Tomorrow will be better.”
Friday, May 24 (ten P.M)
One of the bad ones
The hotel dining room was open by the time I finished the previous entry, so I went down for some
breakfast, then came back to the room and slept till midafternoon. At the theater everyone was
disheartened because they’d failed to get the announcement of B’s talk in today’s paper. It’ll appear
tomorrow, but everyone knows this means the turnout will be even more dismal than expected.
I was frightened looking at B. She was wafer pale, nervous, and visibly shrunken, as if she’d aged
ten years overnight. The life had gone out of her hair and her eyes, and I thought I saw a tremor in her
left hand. Until then, in truth, I’d never really believed in her illness. Now I thought she should be in a
hospital bed—or at least in some bed, with someone bringing cups of tea laced with honey, stoking a
small, cheery fire, and reading aloud from The Wind in the Willows.
Around five o’clock she suggested that we get out of there, and I asked to where. When she said the
park, I asked if she really felt up to that. She gave me a sharp look and half of an angry reply, then
seemed to realize I hadn’t earned it.
“I have my good days and my bad days,” she said, with the air of making an admission. “Up to now
you’ve only seen the good ones.”
All the same, we took the Mercedes instead of walking. On the way, B asked if I was a theologian.
“Me? No way.”
“That’s too bad,” she said without further explanation. “I know Charles made this point, but I’m
going to make it again: When St. Paul brought Christianity into the Roman world, very fundamental
ideas were already in place there. The idea of gods as ‘higher beings.’ The idea of personal salvation.
The idea of an afterlife. The idea that the gods are involved in our lives, that their help can be invoked,
that they’re pleased or offended by things we do, that they can reward and punish. Notions of sacrifice
and redemption. These were all things that Paul didn’t have to explain from scratch.”
I thought I saw where she was headed. I said, “Whereas, working with someone like me, you have to
struggle to unseat these fundamental ideas and to replace them with others I’ve never heard of.”
“That’s right. When Christians began sending missionaries to ‘savage lands,’ they were faced with
the same difficulty I have with you. The aborigines didn’t have any idea what the missionaries were
talking about.”
“That’s true.”
“Charles and I are the first animist missionaries to your world—the world of salvationist, revealed
religions—Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism. There’s no blueprint for what we’re
doing. No precedent, no catechism, no curriculum. That’s why it’s so . . . improvisational. We’re trying
to develop the blueprint. We’re trying to figure out what works.”
“This will probably seem like a silly question, but . . . why? Why are you doing this?”
B drove for a minute in silence. Then: “You remember what B said: Vision is the flowing river.”
“Yes . . . ?”
“The religions I just mentioned—the revealed religions—are fundamentally wed to our cultural
vision, and I use the word wed advisedly. These religions are like a harem of sanctimonious wives
married to a greedy, loutish sensualist of a husband. They’re forever trying to improve him, forever
hoping to get his mind on ‘higher things,’ forever bawling him out and shaking their fingers at him, but
husband and harem are in fact completely inseparable. These revealed religions clearly function as our
‘better half.’ They’re the highest expression of our cultural vision.”
“Yes, I suppose you could say that.”
“Here’s what Charles said next: ‘In our culture at the present moment, the flow of the river is toward
- 71 -
catastrophe.’ Does that make sense to you?”
“Yes.”
“Then put it all together, Jared. Vision is the flowing river. The revealed religions of our culture are
the highest expression of that vision, and the flow of the river is toward catastrophe.”
My mind boggled at this. When I failed to reply, Shirin shot me a glance from the corner of her eye
and said, “You wanted to know why we’re doing this. Charles explained it the other night: Our
objective is to change the direction of the flow, away from catastrophe. Nothing less will do the trick,
Jared. Absolutely nothing.”
I shivered. “I think I understand why the crowds call B the Antichrist.”
She smiled and shook her head. “Do you know who the Baal Shem Tov was?”
“I have a general idea. He was a great Hasidic saint, sort of a Jewish Francis of Assisi, about five
centuries later.”
“Close enough. Do you know the meaning of the name?”
“No.”
“A baal shem is a master of names—in other words, a magician. Baal Shem Tov means ‘master of
the good name,’ which is to say a magician of the highest order, capable of wielding the name of God.”
“I see.”
“There once was a merchant who was afraid to travel to a nearby city, because the only route passed
through a forest known to be inhabited by highwaymen. His wife said he should appeal to the Baal
Shem Tov for help, but this just irritated the merchant, who didn’t believe the stories he’d heard about
this supposed wonder-worker. His wife said, ‘Trust me. Go to the house of the Baal Shem Tov and slip
his porter a few coins. The porter will let you know the next time his master is planning a trip through
those woods, and you can go with him. No harm will come to you if you’re with the Baal Shem Tov.’
The merchant reluctantly took her advice and before long had an opportunity to travel with the Baal
Shem Tov.
“When they reached the deepest, most dangerous part of the woods, the Baal Shem Tov called a halt
so the horses could rest and graze. This stoppage terrified the merchant, but the Baal Shem Tov calmly
took out his copy of the Zohar and began to read. Soon the branches alongside the road parted, and the
robbers stepped out and approached, knives drawn. But when they were two or three paces away from
the wagons, they suddenly started to shake uncontrollably. They didn’t know what to make of this, but
they were in no condition to attack anyone, so back they went into the woods. After a few minutes they
recovered and made a second attempt, with the same result: Before they could get close enough even to
touch one of the horses’ noses, they were rendered helpless with palsy and forced to retreat. The
merchant, cowering in his wagon, watched all this with amazement.
“When the Baal Shem Tov finally looked up from his book and gave the word to continue, the
merchant threw himself at his feet and kissed his hand. ‘Now I understand,’ he said. ‘Now I understand
why people call you the Baal Shem Tov!’
“The Baal Shem Tov frowned down at him and said, ‘So you think you understand that, do you?
Believe me, my friend, you’re just beginning to understand!’ ”
The two visions
Once inside the park, B’s exhaustion seemed to slip away from her. She led the way and I followed,
for all the world like a husband being towed through a shopping mall. I didn’t have the least idea what
she was looking for, but she was certainly looking. When we finally stopped, it was in a spot that, for
all I knew, might have been the same one we occupied the night before. We sat down facing a dusty
clearing not much bigger than a dining-room table.
She said, “We have a lot to do here, Jared—a great journey to take—and I’m not sure I’m guide
enough to see you through it. But I’ll do my best.”
I wanted to murmur a word of encouragement but decided against it. She reached in her purse and
drew out of it our work of bricolage. Some reassembly was necessary, as the pen and the fuse were not
snugly held in place alongside the film canister, and when this was done, she handed it to me and asked
if I remembered what it was all about.
- 72 -
“The fossil represents the community of life,” I told her. “Animism is bound up with that community
and resonates with it. The Law of Life, represented by the pen, is written in the community of life, and
animism reads this law, as does science in its own way.”
“Excellent. I’ve called animism a religion, but there’s a very real sense in which animism-as-a-
religion is an invention of Taker culture, an intellectual construct.”
“Why is that?”
“I told you that animism was once a universal religion on this planet. It’s still universal among
Leaver peoples—peoples you identify as ‘primitive,’ ‘Stone Age,’ and so on. But if you go among
these people and ask them if they’re animists, they won’t have the slightest idea what you’re talking
about. And in fact if you suggest that they and their neighbors have the same religious beliefs, they’ll
probably think you’re crazy. This is because, like neighbors everywhere, they tend to be much more
aware of their differences than their similarities. It’s the same with your revealed religions. To you,
Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism look very different, but to me they look the
same. Many of you would say that something like Buddhism doesn’t even belong in this list, since it
doesn’t link salvation to divine worship, but to me this is just a quibble. Christianity, Judaism, Islam,
Buddhism, and Hinduism all perceive human beings as flawed, wounded creatures in need of salvation,
and all rely fundamentally on revelations that spell out how salvation is to be attained, either by
departing from this life or by rising above it.”
“True.”
“The adherents of these religions are mightily struck and obsessed by their differences—to the point
of mayhem, murder, jihad, and genocide—but to me, as I say, you all look alike. It’s the same among
Leaver peoples. They see what’s different between them and I see what’s alike, and what’s alike is not
so much a religion (as religion is understood by Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus) as
it is a religious vision of the world. There is in fact no such religion as animism—that’s the construct:
animism as a religion. What exists—and what is universal—is a way of looking at the world. And
that’s what I’m trying to show you here.”
“I understand . . . I guess.”
“Always keep in mind what we’re about here, Jared. We’re here about visions, you and I. One vision
is sweeping us toward catastrophe. This is a vision peculiar to a single culture, our culture, focused and
sustained by the revealed religions of our culture during the last three thousand years. I’m trying to
show you another vision, healthy for us and healthy for the world, that was embraced by hundreds of
thousands of cultures through hundreds of thousands of years.”
“Okay,” I said. “But you can’t actually know how long it’s been embraced.”
“I think I can, Jared. Consider this: How long have people been living in accordance with the law of
gravity?”
“With the law of gravity? Forever, of course.”
“How can you know that?”
“I suppose I know that because, if people hadn’t been living in accordance with the law of gravity,
then they wouldn’t be here at all.”
“But they didn’t necessarily understand the law of gravity, did they? I mean, they couldn’t express it
the way a physicist might.”
“No.”
“But they knew it was a law all the same. Step off the edge of a cliff and you fall—every time. Drop
the rock and it falls on your toe—every time.”
“That’s right.”
“Now try this: How long have people been living in accordance with the Law of Life?”
“I don’t know.”
“The Law of Life is . . . ?
“The Law of Life is . . . ‘whatever fosters life.’ ”
“So try again, Jared: How long have people been living in accordance with the Law of Life?”
“From the beginning.”
“Why? How do you know that?”
“Because if they hadn’t been living in accordance with the law that fosters life, then they wouldn’t
- 73 -
be here at all.”
“Good. But they didn’t necessarily understand that law, did they? They probably couldn’t have
expressed it the way a biologist would.”
“No.”
“Nevertheless, they could know what they knew about the law of gravity—that it’s there. That a law
is in place. They could know, for example, that infants must be taken care of till they can take care of
themselves. They could know that abandoned infants die—every time. They could know that a lion
will defend its kill—every time. They could know that you don’t necessarily have to be as fast as a
deer to catch a deer. They could know that if you’re stalking any animal that can outrun you, you’d
better be downwind of it. I could go on all night. I could go on for days and weeks, and I wouldn’t be
able to list everything they would know just by the simple experience of living in that community
through thousands of generations.”
“I’m sure you’re right. What I don’t see yet is the connection between this and animism.”
“What is animism, Jared?”
“I’m less and less sure as time goes on. As I understand it right now, it’s a vision. I suppose you
mean a worldview, a weltanshauung.”
“Yes, but I think I’ll stick with vision. This is what we’re about here: two visions, one vision that
enabled us to live well and in harmony with the earth through millions of years, and another vision that
has brought us to the verge of extinction and made us the enemy of all life on this planet in just ten
thousand years.”
“Okay. ”
“And what is the animist vision?”
“I don’t know. I have no idea.”
“Then tell me this: What is our vision, Jared—the Taker vision, the vision that has made us the
master of the world and the enemy of life? Can you articulate it?”
“I can try.”
“Go ahead.”
“We’re the creature for whom the world was made, so we can do what we please with it. That’s a
start.”
“Yes, that’s a good start. According to this vision, God seems to have little interest in the rest of the
world.”
“That’s right. God cares about people. People are the big deal. People are what he made the universe
for.”
“So the world was made for Man, and Man— What was man supposed to do with the world?”
“He was supposed to rule it. It was given to him to rule.”
“But, oddly enough, the world wasn’t ready for him to rule, was it. Man was ready-made to rule the
world but the world wasn’t ready-made for him to rule it.”
“No, that’s true. I never noticed that in particular.”
“So what did Man have to do to make the world ready to rule?”
“He had to subdue it, conquer it.”
“That’s right. And he’s still at it, isn’t he. So, this is the Taker vision: The world was made for Man,
and Man was made to conquer and rule it.”
“Yes.”
“What we’re looking for now, Jared, is the Leaver vision or the animist vision. Before we leave here
today, you’ll have that, I promise you.
Strategies: stable and otherwise
“I want you to understand that what I’m calling the Law of Life was not in any sense imprinted in
the community of life by divine action. God or the gods didn’t give their creatures ‘good instincts’ that
I’m now calling collectively the Law of Life. It didn’t happen that way. To posit such an action would
be unparsimonious, a violation of Occam’s razor. You understand what I mean by that, don’t you?”
“Yes. You’re saying the Law of Life doesn’t have to be explained as a system of divine intervention
- 74 -
any more than the laws of thermodynamics have to be explained as a system of divine intervention.”
“That’s right. A biologist would probably say that what I’m calling the Law of Life is just a
collection of evolutionarily stable strategies—the universal set of such strategies, in fact. Do you know
what an evolutionarily stable strategy is?”
“Madam,” I said, “I am a classicist, not a biologist. In school, I read Homer in the Greek and Cicero
in the Latin. I can give you a discourse on Plato’s proof of the immortality of the soul—and a damned
good one it is, too, if you accept his premises. But I haven’t the least idea what an evolutionarily stable
strategy is.”
“All right. Let’s break it down into parts. A strategy in this context is just a behavioral policy. For
example, yesterday I mentioned a behavioral policy that’s followed by lactating she-goats: ‘Suckle
your own and no other.’ This is evolutionarily stable for goats because it can’t be improved on by any
alternative strategy. For example, it could happen that some goats might follow a strategy of refusing to
nurse any kids at all, including their own. But this will definitely have the effect of reducing their
representation in the gene pool, so refusal to nurse will tend to disappear from the species. Similarly,
some goats might follow a strategy of indiscriminate nursing—suckling any kid that comes along. But
because this shortchanges their own kids, this too will have the effect of reducing their representation
in the gene pool, so indiscriminate nursing will also tend to disappear. The only strategy that will not
tend to disappear is ‘Suckle your own and no other.’ That’s why this particular strategy is
evolutionarily stable: The normal process of evolution, natural selection, doesn’t eliminate it.”
“I understand. This is the Law of Life for goats not because God decided goats should behave this
way but because, in any mix of strategies, goats that suckle only their own will tend to be better
represented in the gene pool than any others. It’s actually a very elegant concept.”
“Science does occasionally produce an elegant concept,” she said with an mildly ironic smile. “I’m
sure you understand that what is stable and unstable for one species isn’t necessarily stable and
unstable for another species. For example, many birds are indiscriminate nursers. They’ll feed any
chick that turns up in their nest, including chicks of other species.”
“Thus giving aid and comfort to the merry cuckoo,” I said, rewarding B’s surprised look with a
mildly ironic smile of my own. “We classicists aren’t total ignoramuses,” I informed her. “The fool
warns King Lear, ‘You know, Nuncle, the hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long it had its head bit off
by its young.’ ”
“I’m glad to know that classicists aren’t total ignoramuses, Jared,” B said, giving me a smile so
sweetly benevolent that, for one terrifying moment, I actually had to struggle to keep from grabbing
her. Noticing nothing, she went on.
“I know you’ve heard Charles mention a colleague known as Ishmael. Though he didn’t use this
terminology, Ishmael identified a set of strategies that appear to be evolutionarily stable for all species.
He called this set of strategies the Law of Limited Competition, which he expressed this way: ‘You
may compete to the full extent of your capabilities, but you may not hunt down your competitors or
destroy their food or deny them access to food.’ In the miscalled ‘natural’ community (meaning the
nonhuman community), you’ll find competitors killing each other when the opportunity presents itself,
but you won’t find them creating opportunities to kill each other. You won’t find them hunting each
other the way they hunt their prey; to do so would not be evolutionarily stable. Hyenas just don’t have
the energy to hunt lions—calories gained by eliminating these competitors wouldn’t equal the calories
spent in eliminating them—and attacking lions is not exactly a risk-free venture. In the same way, in
the ‘natural’ community, you won’t find competitors destroying their competitors’ food—the payoff
just isn’t big enough to make it worthwhile.”
“What would be the motive for destroying your competitors’ food?”
“If you destroy your competitors’ food, you destroy your competitors, Jared. Suppose, for example,
that you’re a bird species that favors foods A, B, C, D, E, and F. Another bird species favors foods D,
E, F, G, H, and I. That means you compete with them for foods D, E, and F. By destroying foods G, H,
and I (which you don’t care for yourself), you can strike an important blow against them.”
“But won’t they just compete all the harder for foods D, E, and F?”
“Of course. That’s why you need the third strategy. You want to deny them access to foods D, E, and
F. That way your competitors will be totally out of luck. You’ll be denying them access to half the
- 75 -
foods they favor and destroying the other half.”
“But as you say, this doesn’t happen.”
“It doesn’t happen in the nonhuman community, but this isn’t to say that it can’t happen. To say that
it doesn’t happen is to say that it isn’t found, and it isn’t found because it’s self-eliminating. Do you see
what I mean? It doesn’t happen that goats refuse to nurse their young, but that isn’t because such
behavior is impossible. There surely have been goats that refuse to nurse, but you seldom or never
come across them, because their offspring die and they lose their representation in the gene pool.”
“I see that,” I said.
“It has happened that a species has tried to live in violation of the Law of Limited Competition. Or
rather it has happened one time, in one human culture—ours. That’s what our agricultural revolution is
all about. That’s the whole point of totalitarian agriculture: We hunt our competitors down, we destroy
their food, and we deny them access to food. That’s what makes it totalitarian.”
My mind reeled for a bit over this. It took me a while to figure out what it was reeling over. Finally I
said, “Look, the subject here is evolutionarily stable strategies, right?”
“Right.”
“There are three strategies here that you say are evolutionarily unstable: Hunt your competitors
down, destroy their food, and deny them access to food. Right?”
“Right.”
“But now you’re telling me that our whole culture is founded on these evolutionarily unstable
strategies.”
“Right again.”
“If these strategies are evolutionarily unstable, then how do we manage to pursue them?”
“Pursuing an evolutionarily unstable strategy doesn’t eliminate you instantly, Jared, it eliminates you
eventually.”
“But how is it eliminating us?”
B cocked her head as if to ask why I was suddenly being so dense. “Jared, where were you the other
night in Stuttgart when Charles was explaining the connection between totalitarian agriculture and
overpopulation? Because six billion of us are pursuing an evolutionarily unstable strategy, we’re
fundamentally attacking the very ecological systems that keep us alive. Just like the goat that refuses to
suckle its kids, we’re in the process of eliminating ourselves. Think about the time line Charles drew in
his talk about the boiling frog. For the first six thousand years, the impact of our evolutionarily
unstable strategy was minimal and confined to the Near East. Over the next two thousand years, the
strategy spread to Eastern Europe and the Far East. In the next fifteen hundred years, the strategy
spread throughout the Old World. In the next three hundred years, it became global. By the end of the
next two hundred years—which is now—so many people were following the strategy that the impact
was becoming catastrophic. We’re now about two generations away from finishing the job of making
this unstable strategy extinct.”
I struggled to my feet and went for a walk.
The eyes begin to open
When I returned fifteen minutes later, I told B what I’d had to get away to think about. I’d heard
everything Charles had said in Stuttgart and thought I understood it, but I hadn’t. In spite of everything
he said, I felt sure he was showing us that our population explosion is a social problem, like, say, crime
or racism. I failed to hear him say that our population explosion is a biological problem, that if we
pursue a policy that would be fatal for any species, then it will be fatal for us in exactly the same way.
We can’t will it to be otherwise. We can’t say, “Well, yes, our civilization is built on an evolutionarily
unstable strategy but we can make it work anyhow, because we’re humans.” The world will not make
an exception for us. And of course what the Church teaches is that God will make an exception for us.
God will let us behave in a way that would be fatal for any other species, will somehow “fix it” so we
can live in a way that is in a very real sense self-eliminating. This is like expecting God to make our
airplanes fly even if they’re aerodynamically incapable of flight.
“This will probably sound very naive,” I said, “but why is this such a secret? Why is this something
- 76 -
I’ve never heard before? Why isn’t this taught in the schools?”
“It’s not a secret, of course. It’s just that the pieces of the puzzle are scattered among so many
disciplines—so many disciplines that rarely talk to each other—archaeology, history, anthropology,
biology, sociology. And who exactly would teach it in the schools?”
“Everyone should teach it,” I told her. “They should teach this first. Reading, writing, and arithmetic
can wait.”
“Well, naturally I agree with you. This is the word of B, Jared: If the world is saved, it will not be
saved by people with the old vision and new programs. If the world is saved, it will be saved by people
with a new vision and no programs. This is because vision propagates itself and needs no programs. In
the last half hour your eyes have begun to open to that new vision. But as yet you have only the bleak
side of the vision—the shadow side.”
I had to agree with that.
“So we come again—as we must, again and again, Jared—to these two visions, the Taker vision and
the Leaver, or animist, vision. A few minutes ago, you did a fine job of articulating the Taker vision,
the vision that has driven our culture through its ten thousand years of triumph and catastrophe. As the
Takers see it, the world was made for Man, and Man was made to conquer and rule it. The next
question is: Where did this vision come from?”
“I’m afraid I don’t quite understand the meaning of the question,” I told her.
“That’s all right. Charles would have insisted on prodding you across this gap, but I’ve promised not
to follow his example. I’ll tell you where the vision came from, and you can tell me whether my
explanation is plausible and persuasive. The Taker vision came from the Taker experience of the world
—from the way the people of our culture made their living, which was, after all, by conquering and
ruling the world. The practice of totalitarian agriculture over thousands of years gave them the idea that
the world had been made for Man, and Man had been made to conquer and rule it. Does that make
sense?”
“Yes, it makes perfect sense. I suppose you could call it a sort of rough-and-ready empiricism:
‘We’ve always lived as though the world was made for us, so it must have been made for us.”
“The important thing to note is that the vision grew out of the lifestyle, the lifestyle didn’t grow out
of the vision. Is that clear?”
“Well . . . it’s almost clear.”
“What I mean is, one day eleven thousand years ago, the Mesolithic hunters of Iraq didn’t get
together and say, ‘Look, we’ve examined the world and conclude that it was made for humans to
conquer and rule. Therefore we should get off our duffs and start conquering and ruling it.’ Rather,
what happened was that, over thousands of years of living like conquerors and rulers, the people of our
culture gradually began to conceive the curious notion that the world had actually been created for us
to conquer and rule. They began to imagine that they were fulfilling human destiny itself.”
“I understand. The Taker vision grew out of the Taker lifestyle, not the other way around.”
“Now, what do you suppose the Leaver vision grew out of?”
“I’d suppose it grew out of the Leaver lifestyle.”
“And you’d be right, of course. And what do you know of that lifestyle?”
“To be honest . . . nothing at all.”
B nodded. “That’s our challenge for today, Jared. I have to reveal to you the vision that grew out of a
lifestyle you know nothing about.”
“Sounds difficult,” I said.
“It is, but I don’t have to teach you everything there is to know about this lifestyle. To articulate the
Taker vision, all you really had to understand was how Takers make their living. Takers make their
living by behaving as though the world belongs to them—and the Taker vision supports that behavior.
There’s a lot more to the Taker lifestyle than this, but this was all you needed in order to articulate that
vision.”
“Yes, I see.”
“I can be—and will be—just as selective as that when it comes to the Leavers.”
- 77 -
Silencing the inquisitor
Having said this, B fell silent. After a few minutes I made a mental check to see if I was supposed to
be working on some question or other, but of course I wasn’t. She wasn’t in a trance or anything, just
seemed to be staring vacantly into the middle distance. Soon I began fidgeting, and she slanted a look
at me.
She said, “I’ve never done this before, Jared, and now that I’m right at the point of doing it, I don’t
know how to begin. I know everything I want to happen, I just don’t know how to accomplish it. I
know where I want to end up, I just don’t know how to get there.”
Since I didn’t really understand the problem, I couldn’t see any way to help, beyond giving her a
reassuring pat on the back, which probably wouldn’t have done either one of us much good.
Finally she said, “I have an idea, but I’m not sure how you’ll take to it. I think my problem is that
our relationship is inherently adversarial. I don’t mean it’s entirely adversarial, but it has an adversarial
aspect to it that just won’t go away. This isn’t your fault or my fault, it’s simply what is. You were sent
here to satisfy yourself and others, to ask questions you would ask and questions they would ask, so
your role here, like it or not, is that of an inquisitor. ‘Like it or not’ is the right way to talk about it, I
think, because you mostly don’t like it but feel you must do it anyway. You must ask for yourself, and
you must ask for those others who sent you here.”
“Yes, that’s right.”
“What I’ve done so far has been fine for the inquisitor.” She laid a finger on our work of bricolage.
“This worked perfectly well for him, didn’t it?”
I nodded.
“My trouble right now is that I can’t think of any way to fill an inquisitor’s eyes with the animist
vision. I really don’t think it can be done. This means we have to take on a pair of new roles.”
I nodded again.
“I had a son once, Jared—not one of the lucky ones. He lived only a few hours, not long enough to
be named, really, but privately I named him Louis, somehow a very grown-up name. I won’t be having
others, for obvious reasons—or if they’re not obvious, you can work them out at your leisure. If Louis
were alive, he’d be eight years old, and I’d certainly be teaching him what I now need to teach you.”
“So what are you asking?”
“I’m asking if you can turn off the inquisitor for an hour and listen to me the way Louis would.”
I told her I thought I could manage that.
“I don’t know whether I’m asking of you something easy or something hard. Probably a lot of men
would find it impossible.”
“I don’t know either,” I said. “But, to be honest, it doesn’t seem like that big a deal. Let me ask this,
though. Are you saying that you want me not to ask any questions at all? That doesn’t sound right to
me, because Louis would certainly be asking questions if he were eight years old.”
She seemed disconcerted by this, maybe even a bit irked. It couldn’t be helped, the question had to
be asked.
She said, “An eight-year-old isn’t an inquisitor.”
“I know that. Give me a little credit.”
She gnawed on it for a while, then said, “Louis would ask questions.” I didn’t bother to point out
that I’d just told her that. “Do you think you can ask his questions and not Fr. Lulfre’s?”
“I think I can, Shirin. Give me the benefit of a doubt.”
She shrugged an unenthusiastic agreement. After spending a few moments in thought, she looked
away. “Don’t be surprised if I say things you don’t expect to hear. These are the things I have to say.”
“I understand.”
“I wish you knew sign language,” she added rather wistfully. “Barriers fall right away in sign.”
I wished I knew it too.

The web
I don’t know what she did during the next few minutes, I wasn’t watching. At junctures like this, you
leave people alone, turn your attention elsewhere, and give them a little room to work in. When she
was ready, she started talking in a low, firm voice—and I unobtrusively switched on my tape recorder.
“I’ve told you I’m dying,” she began. “I know it makes you unhappy to hear this, Louis, but the
closer you come to understanding it, the less unhappy you’ll feel. By the time we’re finished here
today, you still won’t feel good about it, but you’ll be able to bear it. In any case, this is where I have to
begin. You want to understand me and you want to understand what’s going on, and that’s what we’re
going to look at right now. If I were someone else, I’d try to console you with a fairy tale like the one
they tell about Santa Claus every Christmas. I’d tell you that Mommy’s going to be taken up to heaven
to live with God and the angels, and from there I’ll look down and watch over you. The truth is better
than this—partly because it is the truth.
“Let me begin with the great secret of the animist life, Louis. When other people look for God,
you’ll see them automatically look up into the sky. They really imagine that, if there’s a God, he’s far,
far, far away—remote and untouchable. I don’t know how they can bear living with such a God, Louis,
I really don’t. But they’re not our problem. I’ve told you that, among the animists of the world, not a
single one can tell you the number of the gods. They don’t know that number and neither do I. I’ve
never met one or heard of one who cares how many there are. What’s important to us is not how many
they are but where they are. If you go among the Alawa of Australia or the Bushmen of Africa or the
Navajo of North America or the Kreen-Akrore of South America or the Onabasulu of New Guinea—or
any other of hundreds of Leaver peoples I could name—you’ll soon find out where the gods are. The
gods are here.”
For the first time B looked directly into my eyes as she spoke.
“I don’t mean there, I don’t mean elsewhere, I mean here. Among the Alawa: here. Among the
Bushmen: here. Among the Navajo: here. Among the Kreen-Akrore: here. Among the Onabasulu: here.
Do you understand?”
“I’m not sure,” I replied truthfully.
“This isn’t a theological statement they’re making. The Alawa. are not saying to the Bushmen, ‘Your
gods are frauds, the true gods are our gods.’ The Kreen-Akrore are not saying to the Onabasulu, ‘You
have no gods, only we have gods.’ Nothing of the kind. They’re saying, ‘Our place is a sacred place,
like no other in the world.’ They would never think of looking elsewhere to find the gods. The gods are
to be found among them-living where they live. The god is what animates their place. That’s what a
god is. A god is that strange force that makes every place a place—a place like no other in the world. A
god is the fire that burns in this place and no other—and no place in which the fire burns is devoid of
god. All of this should explain to you why I don’t reject the name that was given to us by an outsider.
Even though it was bestowed with a false understanding of our vision, the name animism captures a
glimmer of it.
“Unlike the God whose name begins with a capital letter, our gods are not all-powerful, Louis. Can
you imagine that? Any one of them can be vanquished by a flamethrower or a bulldozer or a bomb—
silenced, driven away, enfeebled. Sit in the middle of a shopping mall at midnight, surrounded by half
a mile of concrete in all directions, and there the god that was once as strong as a buffalo or a
rhinoceros is as feeble as a moth sprayed with pyrethrin. Feeble—but not dead, not wholly
extinguished. Tear down the mall and rip up the concrete, and within days that place will be pulsing
with life again. Nothing needs to be done, beyond carting away the poisons. The god knows how to
take care of that place. It will never be what it was before—but nothing is ever what it was before. It
doesn’t need to be what it was before. You’ll hear people talk about turning the plains of North
America back into what they were before the Takers arrived. This is nonsense. What the plains were
five hundred years ago was not their final form, was not the final, sacrosanct form ordained for them
from the beginning of time. There is no such form and never will be any such form. Everything here is
on the way. Everything here is in process.
“Here, I’ll tell you a story. When the gods set out to make the universe, they said to themselves, ‘Let
us make of it a manifestation of our unending abundance and a sign to be read by those who shall have
- 79 -
eyes to read. Let us lavish care without stint on every thing: no less upon the most fragile blade of
grass than upon the mightiest of stars, no less upon the gnat that sings for an hour than upon the
mountain that stands for a millennium, no less upon a flake of mica than upon a river of gold. Let us
make no two leaves the same from one branch to the next, no two branches the same from one tree to
the next, no two trees the same from one land to the next, no two lands the same from one world to the
next, no two worlds the same from one star to the next. In this way, the Law of Life will be plain to all
who shall have eyes to read: the rabbit that creeps out to feed, the fox that lies in wait, the eagle that
circles above, and the man who bends his bow to the sky.’ And this was how it was done from first to
last, no two things alike in all the mighty universe, no single thing made with less care than any other
thing throughout generations of species more numerous than the stars. And those who had eyes to see
read the sign and followed the Law of Life.
“Do you understand that story?” she asked.
“No, I don’t think I do.”
“No two things alike in all the mighty universe, Jared. That’s the key. That’s why everything here is
on the way and not in its final form. I told you this yesterday when I was talking about the mites that
travel with the burying beetles. If you put these mites under a microscope to study the final form of this
species, you’ll be defeated, because the closer you look at them, the more clearly you’ll see that no two
of them are alike—and if no two are alike, what sense can it possibly make to hold up any one of them
and say, ‘Here, here is the final form of these mites’?
“This is what I mean by abundance, Jared: Even among these apparently negligible mites, no two
have ever been made alike in all the mighty universe, and not one of them has ever been made with
less care than a neutron star or a galactic cluster. The brain in that precious human head of yours is not
more wonderful than one of those mites.”
“I know it,” I found myself saying.
“Would the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God have sent his only-begotten son to save those beetles and
their household mites, Jared?”
“No.”
“But the god of this place has as great a care for them as for any other creature in the world. This is
why I knew you could benefit from seeing those beetles yesterday. Those beetles are a manifestation of
the gods’ unending abundance and a sign to be read by those who have eyes to read. I wanted you to
see how the gods lavish care without stint on every thing: no less upon a beetle whose supreme
achievement is burying a mouse than upon the brain of Einstein, no less upon a mite whose favorite
dish is a fly’s egg than upon the eye of Michelangelo.”
“I do see—or I’m beginning to.”
“Where are we going to find this god, Louis?”
Since she’d called me by my own name just a minute before, I was momentarily flummoxed by her
reverting to Louis. As time went on, I saw that she could address me either way without derailing her
train of thought. Sometimes her message was specifically for Louis (and for me incidentally),
sometimes it was specifically for me (and for Louis incidentally), and sometimes, I suppose, it was for
both of us equally. In any case, my answer to this particular question was a blank look.
“I’m not asking you to make a leap here, Jared. I’ve already told you where we’re going to find this
god . . . but I’ll come back to it later. We’ve got plenty of other things to talk about. You and I, Jared,
always come back to vision. Louis and I always come back to the meaning of death.
“Every creature born in the living community belongs to that community. I mean it belongs in the
sense that your skin or your nervous system belongs to you. The mouse we saw didn’t just ‘live in’ the
park community, the way you might live in an apartment in Chicago or Fresno. Every molecule in the
mouse’s body was drawn from this community and eventually had be [sic] returned to this community.
It would be legitimate to say that this mouse was an expression of this community the way Leonardo
da Vinci was an expression of Renaissance Italy.
“The individual lives in dynamic tension with the community, withdrawing to burrow, hive, nest,
lodge, or den for safety’s sake but never totally self-sufficient there, always compelled to return and
make itself available, as this mouse did. This tension is a phrase of the law, inspiring the trapdoor
spider to seal its burrow like a bank vault and inspiring the spider wasp to become a safebreaker.
- 80 -
“Nothing in the community lives in isolation from the rest, not even the queens of the social insects.
Nothing lives only in itself, needing nothing from the community. Nothing lives only for itself, owing
nothing to the community. Nothing is untouchable or untouched. Every life is on loan from the
community from birth and without fail is paid back to the community in death. The community is a
web of life, and every strand of the web is a path to all the other strands. Nothing is exempt or excused.
Nothing is special. Nothing lives on a strand by itself, unconnected to the rest. As you saw yesterday,
nothing is wasted, not a drop of water or a molecule of protein—or the egg of a fly. This is the
sweetness and the miracle of it all, Jared. Everything that lives is food for another. Everything that
feeds is ultimately itself fed upon or in death returns its substance to the community.”
She paused and gave me a look, which I took and gave back.
“Every strand of the web is a path to all the other strands. Does that make sense to you?”
“Yes, I think so.”
“Where will we find the god of this place?”
I blinked at that and croaked feebly, “This place?”
“This place right here, Jared.”
This was not a question I could handle, so I just goggled at her.
“Ten thousand years ago, this region was the home of a Mesolithic people whose name we’ll never
know. Dig in the ground and you’ll find their hand axes and spearheads. These were Leavers, of course
—animists—and they knew where to find the god of this place. The god of this place is here, Jared.
They didn’t look in the sky or on Mount Olympus. They looked here, where we’re sitting.”
I nodded. That was the most I was up for at this point.
“Here,” she said again, this time patting the ground in front of us.
“Okay.”
“Now I want you to look.”
I shook my head—just a little, just enough to say no, no thanks, I think I’ll pass on this one.
“Come on,” she commanded, and stretched out belly-down in the dust. Not happily, I followed suit.
In the center of the web
“Here is where you’ll learn everything,” she said. “Here is where it all comes together. This is the
center of the web, where past, present, and future are joined and where the human mind was born. I
want you to look. Don’t tell me again that you’re not Natty Bumppo. I heard you the first time. You
don’t have to understand what you see but you must at least make an effort to see what you see.
“A few decades ago, at a time when Lamarckian notions were still occasionally offered as science, it
was popularly theorized that what stimulated the primate brain to grow to human size was our
ancestors’ mentally huffing and puffing to invent tools. This is of course what you’d expect in a culture
like ours that equates advancement with tool use.”
I grunted, to let her know I was still awake.
“The fact is, however, that the human breakthrough wasn’t associated with any tool-making
breakthrough. But it was associated with a different sort of breakthrough, a breakthrough as crucial to
human development as the breakthrough to language. Any idea what I might be referring to?”
“No, none.”
“I’m not surprised. This breakthrough isn’t acknowledged in the Taker version of the human story—
isn’t even mentioned, since it adds nothing to the glory of the Takers. This is the breakthrough that
decisively signaled the acquisition of a uniquely human lifestyle, a lifestyle critically dependant on
intelligence. This is the breakthrough that decisively separated us from the apes. Still no ideas?”
“No, I’m afraid not.”
“You evidently don’t remember discussing this with Charles on the train back from Stuttgart. You
couldn’t imagine what our ancient ancestors might have achieved during the first three million years of
human life, and he tried to show you that what they achieved was a fully human lifestyle.”
“Yes, I remember now. That conversation got rather . . . overwhelmed by events.”
“Travel among the gorillas and the chimpanzees and the orangutans, and you will be—or should be
—struck by the fact that their lifestyle is nothing remotely like the lifestyle associated with even the
- 81 -
earliest humans. The earliest humans, unlike those from whom they descended, were hunter-gatherers.
Throughout the rest of the primate order, all are merely gatherers-foragers. They will and do kill for
food, opportunistically, but none live as hunters. Among the primates only humans are hunters, because
among the primates only humans have the biological equipment to make hunting a mainstay of life—
and that equipment is strictly intellectual. Humans could only succeed at hunting one way. They
couldn’t succeed the eagle’s way or the cheetah’s way or the spider’s way. These were out of reach.
They found their own way to succeed—a way that was out of reach of any other species on earth. Do
you understand what I’m trying to tell you, Jared? We didn’t become human banging rocks together.
We became human reading the tale of events written here-here in the hand of the god. ”
She opened her hand, palm up, to show me what she meant.
“I’m not an expert tracker, Jared, not by any means. Natives of this region—any of those Mesolithic
hunters I mentioned earlier—would be able to tell you about things that had happened here days ago.
Literally every slightest mark you see in the dust here is the record of an event, even if it’s only the
track of a windblown leaf. They’d be able to identify every creature that left a mark here in the recent
past, and they’d be able to tell you when it was here and what it was doing, whether it was hurrying or
moseying, looking for something to eat or trying to get back home.
“I picked this spot to settle in, because I could see that something had happened here that I could
probably figure out. I don’t mean that some great melodrama was played out here, just something. Do
you see this curving line of tracks here? They look like they might have been made by pressing an
outsize zipper in the dirt.”
“Yeah, I see them, now that you point them out.”
“This is the track of a beetle, I haven’t the least idea what species. Obviously a hefty fellow. The
spoor is pretty fresh, not more than a few hours old. You can see where it crosses an older track here,
the track of a squirrel.”
“Surprisingly enough I do see it.”
“Okay. Here comes the exciting part. The beetle is tooling along minding its own business, when
suddenly from over here to the left a mouse leaps onto the scene to have a go at the beetle. You can see
here, the way the tracks are bunched, that the mouse isn’t just strolling, it’s leaping. If we were in the
United States, I’d say it was a chipmunk, but I don’t know what this might be, so I’ll call it a mouse.
Anyway, the mouse grabs the beetle, and here you can see the marks where they scuffle.”
“Yes, I see them.”
“Now the mouse tracks continue off to the right—and the beetle tracks are seen no more. So what’s
written here is that the mouse has snaffled itself a beetle snack.”
We got ourselves back up into a sitting position.
The first thing: reading the signs
“Very impressive,” I said.
“Very unimpressive, believe me, compared to what a real tracker could do, but good enough for our
purpose. There are several things I want you to see from this. The first thing is this: Chimpanzees make
and use tools, so tool-making and tool-using are not uniquely human, but the reading I’ve just done
here is uniquely human. Of course what I’ve done so far is only a sample of the hunting process. It’s
like a still from a motion picture, which can suggest a mood and a theme but can’t convey the process
of the film, which is intrinsically motion. At any moment during the hunt, the hunter is considering
these questions: What was the animal doing when it made this track? How long ago was it here? Which
way was it heading? How fast was it going? How far away will it be by now?—keeping in mind the
season, the time of day, the temperature, the condition of the ground, the nature of the terrain, and of
course the typical behavior of the animal being tracked and other animals in the neighborhood as well.
“Here’s a small example. One day an anthropologist was tagging along with a !Kung hunter in the
Kalihari. Around noon they abandoned one hunt as hopeless and started looking around for something
else to go after. Soon they came across a gemsbok track the hunter judged to be just a couple hours old.
After half an hour of tracking, however, the hunter called it off. He explained that the track hadn’t been
made that morning after all, pointing out as proof a gemsbok hoofprint with a mouse track running
- 82 -
across it. Since mice are nocturnal, the gemsbok track had to have been made during the night. In other
words, this particular gemsbok was long gone.”
“Yes, I see.”
“Now, this isn’t a feat of observation and ratiocination that’s going to win that !Kung hunter a Nobel
prize, but it’s a feat that is light-years beyond anything our nearest primate kin is capable of. An ape
with the right sort of training may persuade you that it’s doing what we do when we talk, but no ape
with any amount of training will ever persuade you that it’s doing what this !Kung hunter was doing
when he tracked the gemsbok.”
“I’m sure you’re right.”
“This is what I’m proposing here, Jared: We didn’t cross the line when we started using tools, we
crossed the line when we became hunters. Our nonhuman ancestors were tool-makers and -users [sic]
but they weren’t hunters, because they didn’t have the mental equipment to be hunters. In other words,
we became human by hunting—and of course we became hunters by becoming human. And, by the
way, hunting is not an exclusively male activity among aboriginal peoples of today, so there’s no
reason to suppose it was an exclusively male activity among our earliest human ancestors.”
“Excuse me—I hope this won’t sound like an inquisitorial question—but it sounds like you’re
saying that we hunted before we were hunters. How can you hunt before you’re a hunter?”
“How can you fly before you’re a flier, Jared?”
“I’m not sure I understand what you mean.”
“The same question has to be resolved for every evolutionary development. Here’s the classic
challenge: If the eye developed gradually, then it was useless till it was all complete and functional,
and being useless, it conferred no benefit on its owner—so why did it evolve at all? The answer is that
something less than an eye is useful to its owner. Any sensory tissue, no matter how primitive, is better
than none. No matter how the eye began, it gave its owner a slight edge. The same is true of a behavior
like hunting. Even the most primitive tracking ability will give you a slight edge over those who don’t
have it—and any slight edge tends to increase your representation in the gene pool. As the hunters’
representation in the gene pool increases, the behavior spreads, and in each generation the best hunters
—even if they’re well below modern standards—will have an edge and will tend to be better
represented in the gene pool. In other words, hunting ability—which in humans doesn’t mean speed or
power but rather intelligence—was the vector for natural selection in the case of human evolution.
Intelligence of a human order wasn’t just a lucky accident; it didn’t evolve just so we could have
beautiful thoughts.”
“It seems like language would have had a role in all this.”
“Of course it did. I told you we became human when we developed a new lifestyle. Nonhuman
primates make their living by foraging, but foraging doesn’t require much communication. A band of
primates can settle into an area and begin foraging without any planning or coordination or cooperation
or allotment of tasks. They just move in, and everybody starts munching. But this sort of behavior
won’t work for primate hunters. You can’t just move in and have everybody start hunting. Hunting
teamwork is what pays off—but in primates no hunting teamwork is genetically wired in, the way it is
with wolves or hyenas. In primates, hunting teamwork can only come about through communication.”
“So you’re saying language developed as an adjunct to hunting.”
“Language developed because it conferred advantages. It didn’t have to confer only one advantage.
Language ability made you valuable as a hunting partner—therefore it also made you valuable as a
mate. Language ability meant you were both more likely to survive and more likely to reproduce.”
“It seems to me that language and hunting developed reciprocally, then. And if that’s the case, then
we became human not just by hunting but by hunting and talking.”
B nodded. “You’re not contradicting me, though you seem to think you are. You’re just anticipating
me. I can’t say everything at once.”
For some reason, this comment struck me as funny, especially when I imagined myself responding
to it with: “Well, why not?” For a moment I thought I’d be able to hold it in and suppress it, but my
central nervous system had other ideas, and I started sniggering, then I started chuckling, then I started
snorting, then I started guffawing—and it was at this point that B decided to join in, and we laughed
ourselves good and silly for about two minutes.
- 83 -
We both ended up gasping for breath and grinning foolishly, with tears running down our faces, and
for a split second she had something in her eye that made me think she almost mistook me for a fellow
human being. Then we both took a deep, shuddery breath, got a grip on our emotions, and went back to
work.
The “hunting gene”
Again she patted the ground in front of us. “I said there were several things I wanted you to take
from this demonstration. The first is that we became human by reading the signs—and of course by
talking. We didn’t become human by banging on rocks or by making up sonnets. Intelligence invited us
to explore a new lifestyle, based on hunting and foraging rather than just foraging alone. This new
lifestyle demanded—and rewarded—new forms of communication and cooperation.
“Here is the second thing I want you to take from this demonstration. There will inevitably be people
who imagine that I’m offering a rationale for ‘human violence.’ Nothing could be further from my
mind. In the first place, no special rationale is needed for humans, because humans are not remarkably
or unusually violent—outside of our own culture, which represents a tiny, tiny fraction of humanity.
Outside of our culture, humans are violent in the same circumstances that other species are typically
violent—in establishing and defending territory. This has nothing—literally nothing—to do with
political boundaries. Germany isn’t a territory in a biological sense. The connection between political
territoriality and biological territoriality is purely metaphorical. Do you know what I mean by that?”
“I haven’t the foggiest idea.”
“Maybe we can get to it later. Just at the moment I want to make sure you see that, outside of this
one deranged culture of ours, we humans are not more violent than other species—and it wasn’t
hunting that made us as violent as we are. Our foraging ancestors were just as violent. Nonhunters are
just as violent. Vegetarian species are just as violent. Nor are we the only species whose members visit
violence on each other. Nothing could be further from the truth. Aside from predation, virtually all
violence observed in the biological community is intraspecies violence. I can’t explain everything here
all at once, so you’ll have to follow up on this on your own if you’re interested.
“There will be people who will take what I’m saying and make out of it an endorsement of sport
hunting. Again, nothing could be further from my mind. The fact that humans evolved as hunters didn’t
implant in them an irresistible urge to slaughter wildlife. The successful hunter isn’t the one with the
most bloodlust. Bloodlust is not required—is irrelevant. Watch hunters in the wild and you’ll see this.
They don’t go about their business frothing at the mouth, and they don’t kill gratuitously.”
“Excuse me,” I said, “and again I hope this won’t sound inquisitorial. It seems to me I’ve read about
archaeological finds of vast kills of bison that apparently were mostly left to rot by human hunters.
They killed them, picked out the parts they wanted, and abandoned the rest.”
“Improbable as it seems on the basis of the facts you’ve just mentioned, these were not gratuitous or
wasteful slaughters. Hunters in the Old West—I mean hunters of our own culture—could have
explained it. They knew from experience that you could literally starve to death surrounded by bison, if
these were lean animals such as you’d find late in the winter. In the absence of other food, the only way
to survive in the midst of lean bison is to kill vast numbers of them and take what little fat there is. I’m
not going to get into the biochemistry of it here, but if you like I can lend you a book on it.”
I told her I’d take her word for it.
“Where was I . . . ? I was making the point that hunting isn’t violence. Let me put it this way. The
trait that was being saved as we evolved as human hunters was not murderousness, it was a talent for
observation, deduction, forecasting, cunning, stealth, and alertness. These are the qualities that make
for success as a hunter—and they’re not at all specific to hunting. If they were, then we would indeed
be irresistibly impelled to hunt. But there are things that we’re irresistibly impelled to do . . . and you
can see them here.”
She patted the ground in front of her.
- 84 -
The “storytelling gene”
“Tell me what happened here in this spot a few hours ago, Jared.”
“Well, a beetle came walking along, then a mouse leaped out of the grass at the left and made a grab
at the beetle. You said these marks looked like marks of a scuffle, but I don’t know why a mouse would
have to scuffle with a beetle.”
“Maybe the beetle grabbed back.”
“True . . . Anyway, after the scuffle, the mouse carried the beetle off to the right.”
“You understand that this—what you’ve just done—is totally beyond the capacity of any other
animal on this planet.”
“Yes.”
“What exactly did you do?”
“Well . . . actually, I didn’t do anything. You did it.”
“That’s odd. I could have sworn I saw your lips move.”
“Yeah, but . . . What exactly is your question?”
“I asked what you did.”
“You said, ‘Tell me what happened here,’ and I told you what happened. Isn’t that right?”
“Yes, that’s right. What I’m trying to make you see is that the two of us did different things. I did
one thing, and you did another. I want you to put a name to what you did.”
All I could think of to say was that I talked—and I wasn’t going to say that.
“The reason you can’t name it, Jared, is that you undervalue it. Do you know who Koko is?”
“Koko? She’s a gorilla that’s been taught sign language, isn’t she?”
“That’s right. If you sat Koko down here, and a beetle started ambling through the dust, and a mouse
came out of the grass and carried it off, Koko would be able to sign something like, ‘Bug bug mouse
bug run fight mouse run bug.’ If, ten minutes later, you were able to convey to her your desire for a
description of what she’d seen (which is pretty unlikely), the best you could expect would be
something like this: ‘Koko mouse see mouse bug Koko see.’ Even that would be remarkable. But what
Koko will never be able to do is what you did, which is . . ?”
“To put it all together into a story.”
“Exactly.” B patted the ground in front of her. “This is where storytelling began, Jared. This is where
people began to read the world as a collection of stories. There isn’t a child anywhere in the world, in
any culture of the world, that doesn’t want to hear a story—and everywhere in the world, in every
culture of the world, a story is a story is a story: beginning, middle, and end. Beginning: ‘One night a
mouse was traveling through the tall grass on its way home when it suddenly spotted a great black
beetle lumbering across a clearing just ahead. “Well,” thought the mouse, “beetles aren’t exactly my
favorite food, but protein is protein!” ’ Middle: ‘So the mouse hid in the grass until the beetle was just
a leap and a bound away, then it rushed out and attacked. To the mouse’s surprise, however, the beetle
had a powerful set of jaws of its own, which closed around the mouse’s nose. Back and forth the two of
them fought until at last the mouse managed to dislodge the beetle.’ End: ’ “I’ve got you now,” the
mouse said, using its sore nose to flip the beetle onto its back. Carefully avoiding the beetle’s waving
legs and snapping jaws, the mouse gobbled up the beetle and happily trotted off toward home.’ ”
“Very nice, but . . . Do you really think we have a storytelling gene?”
“Well . . . a geneticist would wince at such an expression. There is no single gene in there you can
pop out and label ‘storytelling.’ The theory I’m putting forward here is that storytelling is a genetic
characteristic in the sense that early human hunters who were able to organize events into stories were
more successful than hunters who weren’t—and this success translated directly into reproductive
success. In other words, hunters who were storytellers tended to be better represented in the gene pool
than hunters who weren’t, which (incidentally) accounts for the fact that storytelling isn’t just found
here and there among human cultures, it’s found universally.”
- 85 -
Reading the future
“The people of the Great Forgetting are quite content to imagine that the human story began just a
few thousand years ago when people started building cities, but here is where we became human in the
first place. I’m not talking about how we came to walk on two legs or how we came to lose our hair.
We were two-legged and hairless for hundreds of thousands of years before we crossed this border.”
Again she patted the ground in front of us.
“This is where the temporal structure of the universe began to be imprinted on the human brain.
These tracks in front of us are of course with us in the present, but they won’t make any sense until we
recognize them as traces of past events. They would be meaningless to any other species, because no
other species would be able to read them as traces of the past.”
“Isn’t this what a dog does with a scent?”
“No, not at all. Sitting here, you and I are releasing a physical emanation of ourselves into the air.
This scent, this physical emanation, extends all the way back to the car, and a dog encountering it there
could easily follow it here, but it wouldn’t be reading the past, it would be reading the present. It would
be following its nose to us just the way you might follow your ears to an outdoor concert blocks away.”
“Yes, I see the distinction.”
“To return to the traces on this patch of ground before us: In order to make sense of them, you not
only have to recognize that they’re traces of past events, you have to recognize that they have a
direction in time: beginning, middle, and end. The beetle’s story begins here, progresses to here, and
ends there, where it intersects the mouse’s story. We can see that the mouse’s story continues—into a
future that we can make predictions about. Sometime last night, a mouse was here, and now it’s gone—
headed thataway. If we follow those tracks, we know we’re eventually going to find something
standing in those tracks—and that something is going to be what?”
“A mouse.”
“A mouse, Jared, that we have never laid our eyes on until that moment! You see what I’m saying?
Sitting right here, we’ve gained the capacity to foretell the future. We’ve become seers! A few minutes
ago I tried to make it plain that becoming hunters didn’t endow us with an irresistible urge to slaughter
wildlife, but it does give us some other urges that do seem irresistible. For example, we do seem to be
irresistibly attracted to stories, everywhere and everywhen.”
“Yes.”
“Here’s another urge that came to us through hunting: the urge to know what we’re going to
encounter on that track ahead of us. Each and every one of us wants to know the future—by any means
whatever, rational or irrational, sensible or fantastic. This is so deeply ingrained in us, so much taken
for granted, that we don’t give a moment’s thought to how remarkable it is. For many of us, every
smallest action gives us purchase on the future. On getting up, we dress a certain way in anticipation of
meeting a certain person. We read the paper not so much to find out what has happened as to find out
what’s likely to happen—in world affairs, in politics, in business, in sports, and so on. We check the
weather forecast to see if we’ll need an umbrella. On our way to work, we review our plans for the day,
which will undoubtedly involve making plans for tomorrow, for next week, maybe even for next year.
A good day is likely to be viewed as a day that turns out as planned, that has no unpleasant surprises.
At some point we make plans about how we’ll spend the evening. We’ll undoubtedly spend time
thinking about things that need to be done in anticipation of future events. We’ll order plane tickets,
make hotel reservations, arrange for someone to receive a gift on a birthday days or weeks hence.
“It would be hard for us even to imagine an intelligent species that wasn’t obsessed with the future
—and perhaps a species that wasn’t obsessed with the future could never seem fully intelligent to us at
all. Beyond all the presumably rational planning I just described, every single one of us is a reader of
omens and signs—no matter how much we pooh-pooh it. When we get up in the morning and the
newspaper on the lawn is soaked and the milk in our cereal is sour and the shirt we intended to wear is
in the laundry and the car won’t start, there’s not one of us who can avoid thinking, ‘This is going to be
a rotten day.’ There’s not one of us who can pick a winner at the track without thinking, ‘I knew it!’
There’s not one of us who can get a call from someone we’ve just been thinking about without feeling
a twinge of pride in our clairvoyant abilities. I have utterly no rational belief in astrology, but if
- 86 -
someone reads me my horoscope, a tiny part of me always listens and says, ‘Yes, yes, that could
happen, that makes sense.’
“You and I might insist that we have no belief in anyone’s ability to predict the future, but others are
not so snooty and will give ready credence to their psychic reader, their tarot reader, their palm reader,
their aura reader, their I Ching reader, their dream reader. And this is something that cuts across all
cultural lines. Belief in divination is found in every human culture, everywhere in the world. This isn’t
to say that everyone who looks into the future is practicing magic. Astronomy developed as a means of
predicting celestial events. All medical drug research is designed to determine future effects, so that a
doctor can say, ‘Take this pill three times a day, and in two weeks you’ll be better.’ Doctors in all
cultures are associated with divination, including our own, and we expect them to be trained readers of
predictive signs. It doesn’t matter whether we’re in a Stone-Age village or an atomic-age medical
facility, we expect them to say, ‘We’ll follow this procedure today, then tomorrow you’ll be better.’ The
scientific method is itself fundamentally based on making predictions. ‘Theory predicts that doing A,
B, and C will result in D. I’ll test the theory in this way and see whether this prediction is accurate or
not.’
“Because we were born as hunters, we have a genetic craving to know where the track leads and
what lies at the end of it. We have an appetite for the future that is as persistent as our appetite for food
or sex. To say that it’s genetic is of course to propose a theory, but again I see nothing implausible in it.
The hunter who’s not only hungry but avid to know the future is certainly going to have an edge over
the hunter who’s just hungry.”
“Yes, I’d have to think so.”
When the god is with you
“Tell me, Jared, are you a gambler?”
“No, not particularly.”
” ‘Not particularly.’ What does that mean?”
“I guess it means I’m a gambler in a normal, casual way. I’ll spend an evening with friends playing
penny-ante poker, or if someone wants to go to the track, I’ll bet a few dollars just to make it
interesting. But I’m not one of those guys who isn’t alive if he doesn’t have a bet down on something.”
“You sound like you know a guy like that—a compulsive gambler.”
“Yeah, actually I do—my older brother.
“Tell me about him. What’s his name?”
“This is Harlan. Harlan’s very strange to me, an enigma, a being from another planet.”
“Go on.”
I sighed and mentally kicked myself for not having answered her original question so as to avoid this
line of questioning. “Harlan’s just the way I described—not alive if he doesn’t have a bet down. His
reason for getting up in the morning is to check the scores, to find out how he did during the night.
He’ll bet on anything, anywhere. He knows everything. If there’s a football game going on in
Melbourne, he can tell you who the players are, who the coaches are, what their records have been for
the past five years. But he doesn’t love the sports—or the teams. He’s just interested in the point spread
and the odds—and, of course, in winning.”
“Does he lose a lot?”
“No, oddly enough, he doesn’t. I know a lot of gamblers brag about their winnings and lie about
their losses, but Harlan’s honest. And if he didn’t win consistently, or at least break even, he would’ve
gone broke long ago, the way he bets. He thinks nothing of dropping ten thousand dollars on a game. If
he doesn’t have that kind of money at risk, he’s not interested.”
“It has to hurt if he loses.”
“Absolutely. He lives and dies fifty times every day.”
Shirin smiled. “And you really don’t understand what he sees in that? ”
“Well . . . it’s one thing to hear about it and another thing to be around it. He was married once—I
think it lasted three weeks. He doesn’t have friends, he has bookies.”
“What does he do for a living—or is he a professional gambler?”
- 87 -
“No, he’s a real-estate agent, a specialist in commercial property. He spends his days on the cell
phone with clients and bookies and his nights in front of the television switching channels between the
games he’s down on. If they decided to have a sports-free month, I think he’d have to be hospitalized.”
“Doesn’t he do any casino gambling?”
“Oh yeah, I forgot that. Casino gambling is for holidays. He spends his vacations in Las Vegas or
Atlantic City. They’d have to close the casinos for a month too.”
“That wouldn’t matter. He’d find something else to bet on. He’d match coins in bars. He’d shoot
craps on street corners. He’d bet on the weather, on the elections, on the make of the next car turning
the corner, on the number of passengers getting off the next elevator.”
“You’re right, of course.”
“You really don’t see that the two of you are brothers in more than a biological sense?”
“What’s at the root of your brother’s obsession? You say he lives and dies fifty times a day. What
does he live and die fifty times a day to find out?”
“No. What sense do you see it in?”
“He lives and dies fifty times a day to find out if he’s right.”
“No, you’re missing the point entirely. If you bet someone that the Nile is longer than the Amazon,
then of course the issue is whether you’re right. But if you bet someone that the next toss of a coin will
turn up heads, being right has nothing to do with it. The issue is, will the universe back you up? If you
say heads and it turns up heads, it doesn’t mean you’re right, it means God is with you. You could just
as easily have said tails, and if God wanted you to win, then it would have turned up tails. This is what
every compulsive gambler is really trying to find out: ‘Are you with me, Lord, or against me?’ When
Harlan wins, he feels as divinely affirmed as any saint, and when he loses for days on end, he knows
the dark night of the soul, and God has abandoned him.”
“Okay,” I said. “I see what you mean. I remember once, in five-card draw, being dealt the card I
needed to fill an inside straight flush. Getting that card was definitely a religious experience. It was like
a transfiguration. I expected everyone at the table to be blinded by the divine effulgence that was
radiating from me.”
“When you call it a religious experience, are you being facetious?”
“Not at all. I suppose it was the kind of experience called oceanic. I was in a state of cosmic
transcendence. I felt that the universe in that moment had taken notice of me. I was in touch with the
fountainhead of meaning and being.”
“A religious experience but presumably not a Christian experience.”
“No, not a Christian experience.”
“This oceanic feeling you describe has often been conjectured to be the source of the religious
impulse, but only B traces that oceanic feeling to this patch of ground here in front of us, with its beetle
scratchings and mouse scratchings. This is where we first began to reach into a dimension beyond the
ken of any other creature on earth, a dimension that is surely not our own domain. But if we can
imagine it to be anyone’s domain, then whose must it be?”
“It must be the domain of the gods.”
“To flip a coin and bet on heads is to enter the domain of the gods. To draw a card to a four-card
straight flush is to enter the domain of the gods. To read the marks on this patch of earth and begin a
hunt is to enter the domain of the gods. And when the coin turns up heads, when the fifth card fills your
straight flush, and when the hunt succeeds, it doesn’t matter whether you believe in one god, a
thousand gods, or no gods at all, you know that the universe has taken notice of you, that you’ve been
in touch with the fountainhead of meaning and being.”
The sacred harmonic
“Now you understand-or at least I hope you understand—what I meant about the harmonic I was
talking about yesterday. I said that when mental process crossed the border and became human
thought, perhaps thought itself began to resound with a harmonic that corresponds to what we call
religion or awareness of the sacred.”
“Yes. At the time I had no idea what you were getting at. I thought it very unlikely that you’d ever be
- 88 -
able persuade me of such a thing.”
“And now?”
“And now it makes sense. Human thought is thought that opens up into the future, and the future is
inescapably the domain of the gods. Crossing the border, you can’t help but meet them.”
“And you’re in a position now to understand the universality of the animist experience—to
understand why there once was a universal religion on this planet. It doesn’t matter where you cross
the border and meet those gods, the experience is the same. The African experience is not different
from the Asian or the European or the Australian or the American. Every hunt begins here”—she patted
the ground in front of us—“and is pursued into the domain of the gods.”
Dynamiting “Nature”
B asked me to explain again the meaning of our “work of bricolage.” I picked it up and studied it for
a moment. “The fossil shell represents the community of life,” I told her. “Animism is bound up with
that community and resonates with it. The Law of Life, represented by the pen, is written in the
community of life, and animism reads this law, as does science in its own way.”
“Good. We’ve talked about resonance in two connections here, haven’t we, Jared? Human thought
resounds with a harmonic that corresponds to awareness of the sacred, and animism resonates with the
community of life. What’s the connection? Are these resonances actually just one resonance?”
“I’d have to guess they’re the same.”
“They are the same, and once you see this, you’ll be ready to articulate the animist vision the way
you’ve articulated the Taker vision.”
Having said this, B lapsed into a thoughtful silence. Finally, after a couple minutes, she went on.
“Sometimes you have to fill a gap in the road to get people going in the right direction, and sometimes
you have to dynamite part of the road to keep them from heading off in the wrong direction—and of
course sometimes you have to do both, which is where I am right now with you. I think I’ll start with
the dynamiting, though I know I don’t have nearly enough dynamite or enough time to destroy this
section of the road as thoroughly as I’d like.
“You’ll see people turn onto this section of the road when they start talking about Nature, which is
perceived as being something like the aggregate of processes and phenomena of the nonhuman world
—or the power behind those processes and phenomena. As people commonly see it, we Takers have
tried to ‘control’ Nature, have ‘alienated’ ourselves from Nature, and live ‘against’ Nature. It’s almost
impossible for them to understand what B is saying as long as they’re in the grip of these useless and
misleading ideas.
“Nature is a phantom that sprang entirely from the Great Forgetting, which, after all, is precisely a
forgetting of the fact that we are exactly as much a part of the processes and phenomena of the world
as any other creature, and if there were such a thing as Nature, we would be as much a part of it as
squirrels or squids or mosquitoes or daffodils. We are unable to alienate ourselves from Nature or to
‘live against’ it. We can no more alienate ourselves from Nature than we can alienate ourselves from
entropy. We can no more live against Nature than we can live against gravity. On the contrary, what
we’re seeing here more and more clearly is that the processes and phenomena of the world are working
on us in exactly the same way that they work on all other creatures. Our lifestyle is evolutionarily
unstable—and is therefore in the process of eliminating itself in the perfectly ordinary way.”
“I think I understand all that.”
“Even understanding all that, I assure you, people will say to you, ‘All the same, don’t you think we
need to get closer to Nature?’ To me, this is as nonsensical as saying that we need to get closer to the
carbon cycle.”
“I understand. On the other hand, some people do like to be outdoors.”
“That’s fine, of course—so long as they don’t insist that sitting in a forest glade is ‘closer to Nature’
than sitting in a movie theater.”
- 89 -
Through the eyes of deer
“No one would ever think of saying that a duck or an earthworm is ‘close to Nature,’ and it’s
similarly true that our animist ancestors were not ‘close to Nature.’ They were Nature—were a part of
the general community of life. They belonged to that community as fully as moths and skunks and
lizards belong to it—as fully and, I might add, as thoughtlessly. I mean they didn’t congratulate
themselves for belonging to it, they took it for granted. The same is true of modern Leaver peoples.
They don’t belong to this community of life as a matter of principle or because they think it’s right or
noble or ‘good for the children’ or ‘good for the planet.’ I point this out to drag my feet against the
current tendency to angelize them, which I personally think is no better than demonizing them the way
our great-grandparents did. They don’t need to be angelized. They do indeed have a lifestyle that’s
healthier for people and healthier for the planet, but they don’t hold on to it because they’re noble, they
hold on to it for the best reason in the world—because they prefer it to ours and would rather be dead
than live the way we do.”
I nodded to let her know I was with her so far.
“Living in the community of life did give them something we’ve lost, which is a complete
understanding of where we come from. Children in our culture think that life comes to us from our
human parents and that food is just another product we manufacture, like paint or plastic or glass.
Children in hunting-gathering cultures know that life doesn’t come to us only from our parents. It
comes to us just as truly from all the living things we subsist on. These plants and animals aren’t
products any more than we are, and if we live in the hand of the god, then so do they in exactly the
same way.”
She shook her head, obviously dissatisfied. “There are some things prose just can’t handle, Jared.
Let me address this to Louis.”
She closed her eyes. “The people I learned the Law of Life from, Louis, are the people who actually
gave the law that name, the Ihalmiut Eskimos, who lived in the Great Barrens of Canada, inside the
Arctic Circle. Theirs was a strange life by our standards, but its strangeness makes it very easy for us to
comprehend. The Ihalmiut were the People of the Deer. They were this because deer was what they
lived on. They were completely dependent on the deer, because other animals were rare, and vegetation
that’s edible by humans is practically nonexistent inside the Arctic Circle. It’s hard to imagine living
entirely on meat—never a piece of bread, never a piece of chocolate, never a banana or a peach or an
ear of corn—but they did and were perfectly healthy and happy.
“They’d never have to explain who and what they were to their own children, but if they did, they’d
say something like this: ‘We know you look at us and call us men and women, but this is only our
appearance, for we’re not men and women, we’re deer. The flesh that grows on our bones is the flesh
of deer, for it’s made from the flesh of the deer we’ve eaten. The eyes that move in our heads are the
eyes of deer, and we look at the world in their stead and see what they might have seen. The fire of life
that once burned in the deer now burns in us, and we live their lives and walk in their tracks across the
hand of god. This is why we’re the People of the Deer. The deer aren’t our prey or our possessions—
they’re us. They’re us at one point in the cycle of life and we’re them at another point in the cycle. The
deer are twice your parents, for your mother and father are deer, and the deer that gave you its life
today was mother and father to you as well, since you wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for that deer.’ ”
She opened her eyes and glanced at me—a signal, I assumed, that she was once again addressing me
rather than her son.
“This perception of our kindredness with the rest of the community of life is fundamental to the
animist vision, Jared, though it’s naturally very mysterious and improbable to people of our culture.
Everyone should spend some time with the cave paintings of the Upper Paleolithic—and I don’t mean
as an exercise in art appreciation. To identify these paintings as art as we understand it is to look at
them very cursorily. They’re magnificent and brilliant, but they weren’t done for the sort of motives
that we attribute to painters like Giotto or El Greco or Rembrandt or Goya or Picasso or de Kooning.
Nor is there really any reason to suppose that they were painted as magical hunting aids. What’s clear
from examination is that these are hunting guides—visual aids for hunting instruction. For example,
again and again, instead of being shown in profile—the way the rest of the animal is shown—the
- 90 -
animal’s feet are turned up to show the track-making surface they present to the ground. Another way
of showing the same thing is to paint the animal’s track right on its picture or beside it, and this too is
seen again and again. Attention is paid to animal droppings and to what animals look like when they’re
producing those droppings (which I suppose is an activity hunters can take advantage of). Attention is
paid to animals rolling on the ground, making wallows, and digging up the ground—all important signs
for the hunter. Animals are shown in association with plants they feed on (‘find the plant, find the
animal’), with animals that prey on them (‘follow the predator, find the prey’), and with symbiotic
species (‘follow the swallows, find the bison’). Attention is paid to animals making characteristic roars
and bellows. Attention is paid to what you’re likely to see if most of an animal is hidden by rocks or
tall grass—a pair of antlers, a distinctive hump. Attention is paid to seasonal cues to behavior—‘when
the salmon are jumping like this, look for the stags to be on the move as well.’ These caves aren’t art
galleries or shamanistic temples, they’re schools of the hunting arts—the equivalent of one of our
museums of science and industry.”
After trying to digest all this, I told her I was confused. “You brought up the caves as if spending
time in them would convince anyone that our hunting ancestors felt a kindredness with the rest of the
living community.”
“And here I am stripping away all the magical aspects of the paintings.”
“That’s right.”
“I’ll stand by the recommendation. I guess I’m not talking about magic, I’m talking about something
like ‘feeling tone.’ These hunters obviously revered the animals they were painting—were in awe of
them, idolized them the way people in our culture idolize movie stars and sports heroes. To paint them
the way they did, they had to feel a joyous involvement and identification with the magnificent
creatures they hunted. But I can see you’re still not much convinced by all this. It’s difficult to be
persuasive in the absence of the paintings themselves. Have you ever seen a reproduction of one that’s
usually called The Sorcerer?”
“I think I have, though I don’t recall it in any detail.”
“It’s conventionally interpreted as a shaman wearing a ritual mask, but you have to be pretty literal-
minded (and not much of an anatomist) to see him this way. He has the antlers and body of a stag, the
ears of a lion, the face of an owl, and the tail and genitals of a horse—and there’s not the slightest
indication that he’s wearing a mask. I believe he’s unique in Paleolithic art in that he doesn’t just
inhabit the plane on which he’s painted. He does something no other man or creature does; he looks out
of the plane on which he’s painted and gazes into our eyes—with his strange owl eyes. The rule in
conventional cinematic narrative is that the actor must never, ever look directly into the ‘eye’ of the
camera, because if he does that, this shatters the illusion that he’s interacting with the other people we
see on the screen. If he looks into the camera, he’s suddenly interacting with us. The man-beast on the
wall of Les Trois Frères cave is unquestionably interacting with us—introducing himself graphically in
the absence of text: ‘Here,’ he’s saying, ‘you can see what I am-I’m not just a man. I wouldn’t be
nearly so marvelous if I were just a man. Look closely and you’ll see man, horse, owl, lion, and stag.
I’m a compound of all these, and have you ever seen anything more beautiful?’ ”
I smiled, shrugged, and shook my head. “I guess I just like the way you said it better than the way
these guys painted it.”
She shrugged back. “Lillian Hellman once said something that surprised me: ‘Nothing you write will
ever come out the way you hoped it would.’ Not her exact words but something like that. It surprised
me because I thought, ‘Hey, you’re in complete control of what goes on the page, so why shouldn’t it
come out the way you want it to?’ I suppose the answer is that what we hope to achieve is always
beyond human power. We want to make the earth tremble and the stones weep and the skies open up. I
wanted to do that for you here, right now, but I know I haven’t.”
For a moment I almost thought this was an odd sort of ambition for anyone to have. Then I
remembered myself as a young man. My own ambitions had not been so different, but they’d grown
dry and insubstantial, and the winds and rains of time had eroded them to almost nothing.
- 91 -
The web endlessly woven
“I said I was going to be selective in what I revealed to you about the Leaver lifestyle, so you’d be
able to articulate the animist vision as easily as you were able to articulate our own vision.”
“I remember.”
“I told you this little patch of dirt here in front of us is where it all begins—human thought, human
awareness of the sacred, and human history—but as many times as I’ve come back to it, I don’t think
I’ve ever been completely forthright with you. I’ve been diffident. I haven’t spelled it out—because, I
suppose, in spite of everything, I fear the sneering superiority of your kind.”
I didn’t want to ask what kind “my kind” is (and probably didn’t need to, either). Instead I made the
mistake of asking her if she’d ever actually seen me sneering.
“Many times, I’m afraid. I know you’re not aware of it, and I know you try to suppress it, but I also
know this isn’t easy for someone with your intellectual and cultural indoctrination.”
“I’m sorry,” I said, inadequately. “Profoundly.”
“I know it. Charles knew it too. Otherwise you wouldn’t be here.”
I pondered that for a while and finally said, “I guess if you want me to do what you say you want me
to do, then you’re going, to have to say the things you’re afraid to say.”
“You’re right, of course,” she said, “and I know it.”
“Say them to Louis, if that helps. In a way, it helps me too.”
“Okay, I’ll do that when I have to,” she said. “Meanwhile . . . An hour ago—I don’t know if you’ll
remember it—I told you we became human reading the tale of events written here—here in the hand of
the god. And I showed you my own hand, like this. Do you know what I meant by that?”
“I’m not sure.”
“Do you see these marks in my hand?”
“Of course.”
“I’m comparing them to these marks.” She indicated the tracks of the beetle and the mouse. “Both
sets of marks are tracks—marks left by the passage of life. It’s my notion—and of course it’s just a
notion—that these tracks, found here in the hand and here on the ground, gave rise to the notion that
we live in the hand of the god of this place.”
She reached out and dragged her forefinger across the track of the beetle.
“Shirin’s mark,” she said. “Like the beetle and the mouse, once upon a time, I was here. And if
another comes to study these marks, he or she will say, ‘All three were here, at different times, all held
in the hand of the god—and all still held in the hand of the god though they’re no longer right here.’
Every track begins and ends in the hand of god, and every track is a lifetime long. Hunter and hunted
are both standing in their tracks when they meet, and there are no tracks, however far-flung, that fall
outside the hand of god. All paths lie together like a web endlessly woven, and yours and mine are no
greater or less than the beetle’s or the mouse’s. All are held together.
“These are things I’d like to say to Louis. We make our journey in the company of others. The deer,
the rabbit, the bison, and the quail walk before us, and the lion, the eagle, the wolf, the vulture, and the
hyena walk behind us. All our paths lie together in the hand of god and none is wider than any other or
favored above any other. The worm that creeps beneath your foot is making its journey across the hand
of god as surely as you are.
“Remember that your tracks are one strand of the web woven endlessly in the hand of god. They’re
tied to those of the mouse in the field, the eagle on the mountain, the crab in its hold, the lizard beneath
its rock. The leaf that falls to the ground a thousand miles away touches your life. The impress of your
foot in the soil is felt through a thousand generations.”
In the sea of grass
“I’m at the end of my strength for now, Jared, but I want to take one more field trip before we call it
a day. This will be a mental one, so you won’t have to put on your Natty Bumppo hat. Where did you
grow up?” I told her Ohio. “I’ve never been there, but it can’t be entirely different from where I grew
up, out in the Great Plains. It’s not all cornfields, even today. I want you to travel with me to a place I
- 92 -
remember as a child, a plains wilderness. . . . Once when I was a kid I remember watching an old
western movie on TV called The Sea of Grass. I don’t know what it was about. All I remember is one
scene where Spencer Tracy looks out over this vast sea of grass stretching from horizon to horizon, and
the wind’s stirring it up and sending it into waves just like the sea. The place I’m talking about wasn’t
as huge as that, but it was the same kind of place. Close your eyes and see if you can picture such a
place.
“The important thing to realize is that this isn’t grass, Jared. This is deer and bison and sheep and
cicadas and moles and rabbits. Reach down and grab a handful. Go ahead—at least mentally. Have you
got it? That’s a mouse. And the mouse, the ox, the gazelle, the goat, and the beetle all burn with the fire
of grass, Jared. Grass is their mother and father, and their young are grass.
“One thing: grass and grasshopper. One thing: grasshopper and sparrow. One thing: sparrow and fox.
One thing: fox and vulture. One thing, Jared, and its name is fire, burning today as a stalk in the field,
tomorrow as a rabbit in its burrow, and the next day as an eleven-year-old girl named Shirin.
“The vulture is fox; the fox, grasshopper; the grasshopper, rabbit; the rabbit, girl; the girl, grass. All
together, we’re the life of this place, indistinguishable from one another, intermingling in the flow of
fire, and the fire is god—not God with a capital G, but rather one of the gods with a little g. Not the
creator of the universe but the animator of this single place. To each of us is given its moment in the
blaze, Jared, its spark to be surrendered to another when it’s sent, so that the blaze may go on. None
may deny its spark to the general blaze and live forever—not any at all. Certainly not me, for all my
giant intellect. Each—each!—is sent to another someday. You are sent, Jared—Louis. You’re on your
way, both of you. I too am sent. To the wolf or the cougar or the vulture or the beetles or the grasses, I
am sent. I’m sent and I thank you all, grasses in all your forms—fire in all your forms—sparrows and
rabbits and mosquitoes and butterflies and salmon and rattlesnakes, for sharing yourselves with me for
this time, and I’m bringing it all back, every last atom, paid in full, and I appreciate the loan.
“My death will be the life of another, Jared—I swear that to you. And you watch, you come find me,
because I’ll be standing again in these grasses and you’ll see me looking through the eyes of the fox
and taking the air with the eagle and running in the track of the deer.”
The secrets
“These are our secret teachings, Jared. I know Charles told you that secret teachings are ones that
teachers have a hard time giving away. Do you see now why this is so?”
“Yes.”
“The Leaver peoples of the world have been trying to tell you these things for centuries, but they
still remain secrets. Certainly we haven’t hidden them—far from it. We’re not like high-degree
members of the Freemasons or the Templars or the Ku Klux Klan, whispering secrets in locked rooms
and exacting promises of silence from those who hear them. Wherever people behave that way, you
can be sure they’re guarding either very paltry secrets or simple matters of fact, like where the Allies
planned to invade Europe at the end of World War Two. Real secrets can be kept by publishing them on
billboards.”
By this time we were walking back to the car.
B said, “When we began this process, you offered this as the Taker vision: The world was made for
Man, and Man was made to conquer and rule it. Have I given you enough to articulate the Leaver, or
animist, vision?”
“I think so.”
We walked on, and, thankfully, she didn’t prompt me. Finally, as the street came in sight I paused
and said, “This is the best I can do. It doesn’t seem very elegant to me.”
“It won’t cause the ground to tremble.”
“No. Nor will the stones weep or the heavens open up.”
“I know what you mean, Jared, I really do.”
“The world is a sacred place and a sacred process,” I told her, “and we’re part of it.”
“That’s excellent, Jared, simple and to the point. This is what was understood—and is still
understood among Leaver peoples. Wherever you went in the world, you found people who took it for
- 93 -
granted that the world is a sacred place, and that we belong in that sacred place as much as any other
creature in the world.” Smiling, she looked around the park, as if giving it a silent farewell. Then she
included me in the smile as she said, “Maybe someday someone will find a way to say it that makes the
ground tremble.”
The fossil
About halfway back to the hotel, I said, “You were going to tell me what Charles had in mind with
the ammonite fossil he gave me.”
“Oh yes.” She drove on for a couple of blocks, then pulled over and parked. “Charles was much
better than I am with this aspect of things. He would have sat you down and made you see how past,
present, and future were woven together at that little patch of ground. He would have shown you that
you really could read the future from the signs you saw there. Nothing magical. As I said myself, we’re
all involved in reading the future all the time. He was fond of pointing out that our fascination with the
hunt hasn’t disappeared in modern times, it’s just found a new object—the mystery story, where all the
classic talents come into play: observation, deduction, forecasting, cunning, stealth, and alertness.”
“What does this have to do with the fossil?”
“Where is it?”
I dug it out and handed it to her.
“I suspect he planned to ask you the future of this fossil, which is at least sixty million years older
than the human race. That’s an awful lot of its past that you know. What do you know of its future?”
“Nothing at all.”
She laughed and shook her head. “I’m sure he could have predicted that answer without any
difficulty.”
“I’m sure he could,” I said, a bit miffed.
“Come on,” she said, getting out and going round to the trunk, where she took out a tire iron and
handed it to me.
“What am I supposed to do with this?”
She walked over to the curb, sat down, and, when I joined her, she set the fossil between us and told
me to smash it to bits.
“I won’t,” I told her.
“No, go ahead.”
“I won’t,” I told her again. “Why do you want me to do that?”
“I want to show you how to read the future,” she said—half laughing, it seemed to me.
I picked up the fossil, returned the tire iron to the trunk, and got back in the car.
“Charles would have done it better,” she said as we drove off. “The point of the exercise needs to be
more fully developed.”
I snorted contemptuously.
“Charles would have got you to smash it.”
“Bah,” I said, unable to think of anything better.
B laughed—to me, in my besotted state, a sweeter sound than birdsong.
At the hotel
I told B not to expect me at the theater tonight, which is just as well, since it took me till eleven
o’clock to finish the foregoing.
I’m now going to go down to the bar, have a couple of drinks, and think about absolutely nothing for
an hour. Then, for a very great change, I’m going to have a normal night’s sleep. Tomorrow night
Shirin addresses the public as B for the first time. I’m frankly fascinated to know how it’ll turn out.

Date unknown
It appears that this was actually written by me.
Date unknown
I, Jared Osborne, write this down for Jared Osborne for when you wake up in the middle of the
night, as you seem to do, and you don’t know where the hell you are. The preceding pages, beginning
“They tell me I’m in a hospital,” were also written by me for when you wake up in the middle of the
night—but I don’t remember writing them any more than I will remember writing this the next time I
wake up in the middle of the night and find it sitting on the table beside the bed.
Date unknown
This is concussion. That’s what you have to get fixed firmly in your head. You have a concussion
and for the time being your long-term memory is out to lunch. We hope it’s “for the time being”—all
of us Jareds who read and write in this notebook. The doctors who patiently tell us their names every
day and that we regularly forget every day, assure us that very probably this is a temporary condition.
May 31
Apparently I sleep a great deal. I have no idea whether it’s for hours or for days. Now, when I wake
up, I reach automatically for this notebook. I don’t remember what’s in it, but I do remember that it has
the answers.
I think the idea is, even if my long-term memory never returns, this notebook can serve as a kind of
cumulative record. I’ve collected a lot of information in the last hour, which I should put down here.
To begin with, I’m back in the United States. (I keep wanting to say we, meaning the Jared who is
writing this entry and all the Jareds who will read it in days to come.) I’m at what seminarians used to
call “the Company Farm,” which is where you go when you “need a little rest”—or a little vacation
from booze—or the whispers about you and the altar boys are beginning to get a bit noisy. All the big
orders have them, of course, some of them have several, thoughtfully specialized. Naturally they’re not
called penitentiaries anymore; nowadays they’re called retreat centers. This one is located in the rolling
countryside about a hundred miles south of St. Jerome’s.
I found this out by picking up the phone on my bedside table. Apparently I always do this. Tim, the
young man who answered (I don’t know that he’s young, but he sounds young), told me to read the
entries in my notebook, and I told him I’d already done that. Then he told me where I was, that I’d
been here for two days, that it was two o’clock in the morning (evidently my favorite time for calling),
May 31.
What he calls “the accident” happened “about a week ago.” If he’s right, then the explosion must
have occurred Saturday, the day Shirin was scheduled to speak at the theater. But Saturday seems
impossible in light of what I recorded that “they” first told me, probably in Radenau. If it happened on
Friday I wouldn’t have been there, since I was planning on a good night’s sleep after spending the day
in the park with B. Therefore I conclude that it probably happened on Sunday.
Tim knows nothing whatever about the explosion except that I was pulled out of the rubble and
reportedly was deemed lucky to be alive.
I asked him how to get an outside line and was told I’d have to talk to Dr. Emerson about that. I told
him I just wanted to call my mother and let her know I’m all right, but he said I’d have to talk to Dr.
Emerson about that. I asked him what other kinds of patients are in this ward, and he said I’d have to
ask Dr. Emerson a question like that. I asked him if he could send someone in to talk to me, and he said
it was the middle of the night and he’d come himself but he had to stay at the desk. I asked him if I
could come find him, and he said this would not be a good idea at this time of night but he’d be glad to
talk to me as long as I wanted, on the phone.
I asked him if this is like a regular hospital, and he said no, not really, because there’s no one here
- 96 -
with, like, you know, diseases, like cancer or pneumonia or appendicitis. This is more like a nursing
home, he says.
I asked him if he could make a call for me, and he said only if Dr. Emerson okayed it. I asked him if
I’d had any visitors and he said he was pretty sure I hadn’t. I asked if any visitors were expected, and
he said there might be but he wouldn’t necessarily know about it very far in advance. I asked if anyone
was asking about me, and he said oh, sure, they call every day to see how you’re doing. I asked who
that was, and he said he doesn’t know.
I said I was surprised they’d moved me from Germany.
He said, “Well, you don’t have any problem functioning, you know. You just forget you’ve done it.
Like now. Everything you’re saying makes sense, but when you wake up in the morning, you probably
won’t remember saying it. You’re not unconscious or anything, you just forget. Like, you’ve forgotten
that we’ve already had this conversation three times.”
“We’ve already talked about all this three times before?”
“Twice last night and this is the third time.”
“I don’t think I’ll forget this time.”
“Good, I hope not. That’s what you said the last time, though.”
I told him I’d tie a string around my finger, and he laughed.
He laughed, but he doesn’t know the really funny part, which is that there is already a string tied
around it.
Saturday, June 1
Morning
All the same, when I woke up, I remembered that conversation with Tim. I’ve lost a week almost to
the hour.
I had to wait till noon to get in to see Dr. Emerson, who was pretty much what I’d pictured him to be
and pretty much what I suppose he has to be to run a joint like this: old enough to be authoritative but
not a senior citizen, unflappable, unimpressible, unsnowable, unmovable—but perfectly friendly and
willing to hear you out.
I said I wanted to talk to Fr. Lulfre, and was surprised to learn that Fr. Lulfre was expected to arrive
at the center today in time for dinner.
Like Tim, Dr. Emerson knew nothing about the “accident.” When I asked for permission to call
Germany, he asked who I wanted to talk to. I was prepared for the question, and offered him a piece of
paper with three names on it. The incredible truth is, I don’t know Shirin’s last name. We were never
formally introduced and there was never a moment when it would have been appropriate to ask. I know
Michael’s last name—to hear it—but it could just as easily be spelled Dzerjinski or Dyurzhinsky as the
way I heard it, Dershinsky. Without a first name, Frau Doktor Hartmann was unfindable. So the three
people named on the list were Monika and Heinz Teitel and Gustl Meyer, the owner of the “leftovers”
shop, Überbleibselen.
Dr. Emerson glanced at the names and observed that it must be the middle of the night in Germany.
“No, actually, it’s just midevening—the best time to call.”
“Do you speak enough German to deal with an operator?”
When I said no, he did something that impressed the hell out of me. Without a moment’s hesitation,
he picked up the phone and started punching buttons. Within sixty seconds he had the German country
code, the Radenau. city code, and had exerted enough force of will to get himself an operator who
spoke English. When he had the numbers, the operator asked him if he wanted to be connected, and he
said yes, try Gustl Meyer. When there was no answer there, the operator tried the Teitels’ number.
When the phone was answered, Dr. Emerson asked if this was Monika Teitel. Evidently the answer was
yes, because he shoved the phone at me.
I said, “Monika, is that you? This is Fr. Jared Osborne. We met in the basement of the theater . . . ?”
“Oh yes,” she said. “What do you want?”
It was just as uncordial as it looks. I said, “I’m calling from the United States. You know I was in the
- 97 -
explosion. . . .”
“Yes?”
“Monika, I’m trying to find out what happened.”
“The theater was exploded.”
“I know, I was there, but I was hit in the head and I don’t remember anything. What I’m trying to
find out is, was anybody down there in the—”
The phone was set down with a clatter.
I waited through a painful minute until I heard the receiver being scraped up again.
“Everyone is dead,” Monika said.
“What? No!”
“I asked Heinz, and he says everyone is dead.”
“But I was told the theater was empty!”
I heard her say “Here!” and another voice came on the line—Heinz’s.
“What do you want?” he said. “All are dead.”
“No! Heinz, I was told the theater was empty.”
“Who tells you this?”
“I was told this in the hospital. They said no one was looking for bodies because the theater was
empty.”
“Ja, so. They tell you.”
“Do you know that Shirin was there?”
I heard a muffled exchange between the two.
“I hang up now,” Heinz said.
“No, wait! Can you tell me Shirin’s last name? Her surname?”
Heinz thought for a moment before saying, “You should be there too.”
Then he hung up.
Afternoon
I spent the next three hours in bed, and the thoughts I thought don’t need to be recorded here.
Around four o’clock some being knocked and made his way in and introduced himself chummily as
Fr. Joe. He wanted to know if he should schedule a spot for me in the chapel.
I said, “What?”
“Tomorrow’s Sunday, Father,” he said to me. I assume you’ll be saying Mass.”
“I will not be saying Mass,” I told him.
Fr. Joe disappeared as if whisked offstage like a puppet on strings.
So at least that much has been settled. I’ve reached and passed the fiftieth degree of losing my faith.
Evening
Tim, my middle-of-the-night confidant, is a Native American, built along the lines of a sumo
wrestler. This is a summer job for him. During the school year he’s a student at junior college in a town
nearby. Not having eaten all day, I was starved, and he directed me to the dining room, which I took
one look at and decided I couldn’t stand right now—too bright and too much conversation that people
would want to include me in.
I went back and asked Tim if I could get a tray sent over, and he said sure, nothing easier.
I told him I was expecting a visitor from St. Jerome’s University by the name of Fr. Lulfre, and he
asked how he’d be arriving. I told him I supposed by car.
Tim looked through his papers and asked if he’d be spending the night.
“I assume so.”
He shook his head. “I don’t think so,” he said. “They’re pretty careful about letting us know this
stuff, and there’s no Fr. Lulfre down here.”
“He’s expected for dinner.”
Tim shrugged and repeated that he didn’t think so.
- 98 -
I went back to my room and, with nothing better to do till my tray arrived, decided to take stock and
see how many of my belongings had gone south while I was going west. Amazingly, except for my
billfold, with all my cash and credit cards, every last thing seemed to be there, including my passport. I
called Tim, and he confirmed my suspicion that the billfold was under lock and key in the office, “for
safekeeping.”
The item of greatest interest was the tape recorder, which had a tape in it that had been run forward
an hour or so. After I’d eaten and returned the tray, I rewound the tape and hit the play button, mentally
crossing my fingers and holding my breath. The first second confirmed my hopes: It was a tape of
Shirin’s speech at the theater on May 25. I stopped the tape to consider the fact that, if Heinz Teitel was
right, these would be the last words I’d ever hear from her. The thought did me no good one way or
another. I pushed the play button and listened.*
* The text of this speech will be found on pages 146-154.
Following my usual practice of letting review material go by unrecorded, I had evidently turned the
tape on in the middle of the speech. It’s not easy to summarize what I felt on hearing what she had to
say. She put it all together at last. I had no idea what the talk was “officially” called. I knew it could
only be called “The Great Remembering.” This was it, the fulfillment of the promise—and it left me
with only about a million questions.
But there was one thing I finally understood beyond a shadow of a doubt, and that was why both
Charles and Shirin declined to formulate a defense against the charge of being the Antichrist. I was
disappointed in myself that I’d been so dense about it, that I’d failed to hear what they were telling me
and what Fr. Lulfre was telling me. At any rate, I finally understood why, when I said that B seemed
harmless, Fr. Lulfre’s reply was, “That can’t be right.”
Indeed, it wasn’t right.
I’ve made a written copy of the speech. In these uncertain circumstances no precautions are
excessive.
Obviously Fr. Lulfre didn’t turn up here tonight—or if he did he’s been asleep for hours.
Three A.M.
I finally figured out why I can’t get to sleep. I’m going to have to learn to think more like a fugitive.
I’m too used to being passive and trusting. It took me two hours of tossing and turning to get the point,
which is that this is a potentially disastrous situation for me.
I don’t know why Fr. Lulfre failed to show up tonight, but I’m damned glad he didn’t, because there
couldn’t possibly be a worse place for me to confront him. If he wanted to, he could lock me up here
and throw away the key. I’ve got to get out of here right now and hope to intercept him on more
favorable ground. Luckily, if there’s a wing of this place that’s high security, this isn’t it. I think I could
make my way out with nothing but the essentials (recorder, notebooks, tapes, and passport), but a
hundred-mile trip with nothing but lint in my pockets is not an appealing prospect. I should at least
make a try at persuading Tim to liberate just one credit card from my billfold in the safe.
Monday, June 3
The fugitive at 35,000 feet
So that’s that. Between now and Hamburg I’ve got a lovely bunch of hours ahead of me in which to
sleep and bring this journal up to date—and in a nice, roomy first-class seat, since no other was
available on this flight. The Laurentians won’t notice the difference, and surely they must expect to
send off their apostates with a little Visa Golden handshake.
Though it took the better part of two hours, Tim was persuadable. I may be dumb, but nobody ever
said I didn’t know how to make myself understood. I made a stab at getting him to throw in the keys to
his car, but no, he wouldn’t go that far. It took a couple more hours, but I did finally manage to hitch a
ride. Priests have to cultivate an innocent, harmless look, which comes in handy on the road (as every
serial killer knows). Once I got to an automatic teller machine, I was home free.
- 99 -
I reached Fr. Lulfre’s office at eleven o’clock in the morning, and by God, there he was, just where
I’d left him almost a month ago—something I hadn’t exactly counted on, since it was Sunday.
He looked up at me from behind his desk, plainly astounded, and said, “You didn’t have to do this,
Jared. I was planning to come see you today.”
He actually didn’t get it; he thought I’d jumped the wall out of mere impatience to be near him.
“I’m here for a reckoning, Fr. Lulfre.”
He capped his pen and set it aside—nice, well-thought-out moves.
“A reckoning, eh? You sound like the staunch hero of some turn-of-the-century melodrama.”
“Different century,” I said, sitting down, “but that’s the idea.”
“What is it you want reckoned?”
“I’ll tell you what I remember, then you can tell me the rest.”
“All right.”
“They said I might or might not eventually remember the explosion, but all I remember right now is
a little flash. For a while I thought it was something I’d dreamed, and maybe it is, but I don’t think so.
Do you know the setup in the theater?”
“Yes.”
“Your man in Radenau laid it out for you.”
Fr. Lulfre nodded, then added, “Our man in Europe, actually.”
“This is the elderly person who introduced himself to me as Herr Reichmann?”
“That’s right.”
“Why didn’t you tell me you already had a man on the ground there?”
He shrugged. “It’s always better if you think it’s all up to you.”
“Then why did he phone me with instructions?”
“He got impatient. Professionals always get impatient with amateurs. You know that.”
I shook my head. “Why did you send me at all?”
“We sent you for exactly the reasons I gave you.” He smiled briefly. “For almost exactly the reasons
I gave you. Under his real name, Reichmann maintains perfectly respectable offices in Berlin, Prague,
and Paris and works on retainer for a dozen different firms and individuals, mostly in the U.S. He’s a
very useful, knowledgeable person, and ninety-nine percent of the chores we give him are routine and
innocuous, but when we asked him to look into Charles Atterley for us, he showed a side we hadn’t
seen before. His approach was, ‘I can’t make out what the blighter is saying, so why don’t I just shoot
him and be done with it?’ Whatever you may think of us after this dreadful experience, Jared,
absolutely no one considered taking such advice. We had to send someone of our own to have a look at
Atterley, and believe me, we very much wanted you to persuade us that he was harmless.”
“And I failed to do that.”
“It was out of your hands, really. He was condemned from his own mouth by the speeches you faxed
to us.”
“And you actually authorized his assassination?”
The man shrugged. “You said it very well, Jared: These days are still those days. Nothing’s changed
in the last five hundred years—or the last thousand—except that heretics can no longer be executed in
public. I take all this as seriously as Pope Innocent the Third, who ordered up a crusade against the
Albigenses. I take it all as seriously as Pius the Fifth, who, when he was the grand inquisitor,
personally instigated the massacre of thousands of Protestants in southern Italy. I take it all as seriously
as Thomas Aquinas, who said, ‘If ordinary criminals may be justly put to death, then how much more
may heretics be justly slain.’ For Thomas well knew that the murderer just shortens his neighbors’
temporal life, whereas the heretic deprives them of eternal life. If you no longer understand the
difference—or if it no longer matters to you—then I assume you’ve lost your faith.”
“You assume rightly, Father. I’m afraid it’s fallen to the modernist fallacy.”
“I’m sorry to hear it,” he said, and I could see that he sincerely meant it.
“Since you quoted me about ‘these days still being those days,’ I assume the resourceful Herr
Reichmann had the theater bugged.”
“Of course he did. It was an obvious thing to do. Atterley and his followers were just too incredibly
trusting to survive for very long as subversives.”
- 100 -
“Yes, they were. So you knew they were recruiting me.”
“Yes. That was an unexpected bonus, and you handled it just right.”
“Except that I ended up recruited.”
“Yes—except for that.” He frowned for a moment, then looked up. “You say you now remember the
explosion?”
“I said I remember a little flash. I’m looking up out of a well at Herr Reichmann, who’s looking
down into the well at me. I think this was the stairwell at the theater.”
“That’s right. That’s all you remember?”
I nodded.
“I’m not exactly sure what happened there. Reichmann’s story is that you blundered into him on the
stairs moments before the bomb was to go off. Evidently you assumed he was up to no good and
wouldn’t let him talk you into leaving the theater with him, and when you headed down the stairs to
warn the others, he slugged you and left you to your fate. This was relatively lucky for you, since that
iron staircase was the only structure that survived both the blast and the collapse of the roof”
“You don’t think it actually happened that way?”
“It may have happened that way. All I know for certain is that this is what Reichmann wants us to
believe, and we’re in no position to contradict him.”
There was nothing for it now but to ask the question I dreaded to ask: “Did Reichmann tell you who
was in the theater when it was destroyed?”
“He indicated that he got everyone.”
I stared at him bleakly.
“His exact words were, ‘The inner circle is gone.’ ”
I said, “Everyone else seems to think the theater was empty.”
Fr. Lulfre shrugged.
“Well, he missed one—me.”
He shook his head. “Jared, you know I think highly of you, but you’re not a charismatic firebrand.”
“I don’t think being a firebrand has anything to do with it.”
Again he shrugged.
“You know, I couldn’t figure out why B insisted on putting his entire schedule on hold while he dealt
with me. It made even less sense after Charles’s death. Do you know what I’m talking about?”
“No, frankly, I don’t. What is it that made less sense after Charles’s death?”
“Why B insisted on spending so much time with me.”
Fr. Lulfre started to tell me that he didn’t know what in the world I was talking about, then the light
dawned. “You’re talking about the woman . . . Sharon?”
“Shirin,” I told him. “Shirin is B.”
“I thought Charles was B.”
“Charles was B, but so was Shirin.”
He shook his massive head, shooing away a bothersome fly.
“B had to spend time with me so that, even if worse came to worst, you could be told that you’ve
failed.”
“You’re being far too elliptical for this old brain, Jared. If worse came to worst?”
“If you succeeded in killing both Charles and Shirin.”
“If I succeeded in killing both Charles and Shirin, then I still will have failed?”
“That’s right. Because you didn’t kill me. I’m not a charismatic firebrand, but that doesn’t matter. I
am B.”
“You are B? You really believe that?”
“It’s not a matter of belief, Father. I’m no longer what I was when I sat here three and a half weeks
ago—and you can’t change me back to what I was.”
Fr. Lulfre leaned forward, interested at last. “And you really think this matters, Jared? You think
you’ll do something different, now that you’re B?”
“Oh yes,” I told him, getting to my feet. “There’s no question about that. That’s a certainty.”
“I’m not sure whether to scoff or to shudder, Jared. But if I had a gun in my desk, I’d take it out and
shoot you dead just to be on the safe side.”
- 101 -
“Would you really?”
“Yes, I would. Do you remember your friend Shirin’s last speech at the theater a week ago? Or did
you lose that along with the explosion?”
“I lost it, but I listened to a tape of it yesterday.”
“I didn’t know that,” he said heavily. “At any rate, Reichmann made a tape of it as well, and played
it for me on the phone. That was what . . .” He spread his hands wide in a gesture of helplessness.
“That was what sealed her fate,” I suggested.
“Yes, that’s right. You see, she showed me more clearly than any advocate of ecumenism why we are
a confraternity, Jared—we Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus. We’ve drawn ourselves up
from the slime in which animism grovels so proudly. We represent what is highest, what is most
upward reaching, transcendental, and sublime in mankind. What stands between the members of the
confraternity are minor rifts. What stands between the confraternity and animism is a gulf as wide as
the gulf between Man and brute, spirit and matter.”
“I agree.
“What will you do now?”
I took the tape recorder out of my pocket and showed him that it was running. “First, I’ll find a safe
place for this tape, Father. You called us too incredibly trusting to be conspirators, but you’re pretty
trusting yourself.”
“You’re quite right, Jared. None of us has been trained to look at the world with suspicious eyes. But
you won’t turn it over to the police.”
“Certainly not. This is my safe-conduct for at least as long as you’re alive. Once the police have it,
it’s worthless for that purpose.”
He nodded. “Yes, you’ll definitely want to find a very safe place for that.”
I left, and because it seemed like to [sic] good time to start being a little less incredibly trusting, I
didn’t turn my back on him till I was outside with the door shut between us.

Radenau revisited
I’m installed in my old room at the hotel, and it feels rather eerie. The desk clerk acknowledged my
appearance without surprise, allowing himself the liberty of hoping I was now completely restored
after my “unpleasant experience” of nearly being blown to bits.
I arrived early enough to do a little useful groundwork. I picked up a few necessities like underwear
and shaving equipment and spent some time with telephone directories at the library. I managed to
place a display ad in the local paper asking Shirin or Michael to contact me. Naturally the ad takers
would accept nothing but real money, so tomorrow I’ll have to see if this piece of magic plastic will
actually produce more cash if inserted in the proper slot of some proper machine.
My work with the phone books paid off to the extent that I managed to locate Frau Doktor
Hartmann; she says my head should be cut off and thrown to the dogs, and torture wouldn’t induce her
to help me find either Michael or Shirin if they were alive; although beyond prosecution, I am, in her
opinion, guilty of their murder. On this basis, I guess I can cross Frau Hartmann right off my list of
supporters.
I talked to half a dozen people with first names approximately Michael and last names
approximately Dershinsky and have dozens more to try as far north as Hamburg and as far south as
Hannover, and if I want to try as far east as Berlin, I should be able to keep busy through Columbus
Day.
It’s now eight P.M., and I’m running on three cylinders. All I can do at this point is stay awake long
enough to reset my biological clock to local time.
In truth, I’m not exactly sure what I’m doing here. I suppose I’m here to prove that Herr Reichmann
and Heinz Teitel are wrong, the inner circle is not gone—but I don’t know how to go about it. I can’t
seriously expect city officials to dig up a million tons of rubble to prove something they already
believe to be true. What then? The Teitels aren’t going to be any more helpful in person than they were
- 102 -
over the phone. Can I imagine myself persuading the guardians at Shirin’s clinic that I’m a close friend
who should be given her address and phone number even though I don’t know her last name? No,
frankly I can’t. Of course, I can just plant myself on the front steps of the place and see if she shows up
someday.
For the moment I can’t think of anything else useful to do. For the moment I’m too jet-lagged to
think at all.

Plastic death
This morning I found myself a money machine, shoved in my plastic, and learned that I’d ceased to
exist. My card had been revoked and was fresh out of magic. I considered myself lucky. They could’ve
been a day quicker, in which case the card wouldn’t have passed muster at the hotel.
I had a couple of choices. I could cash in my return plane ticket or I could call home and ask my
mother for a loan. I decided to cash in the plane ticket. I then had to think about my position with the
hotel. As long as I didn’t try to use the card again there, I figured I was okay, and the hotel would not
get stiffed, since the card was still valid when I checked in. Presumably the Laurentians would get
stuck with the bill, which did not tax my delicate conscience at all.
Since the airline has no office in Radenau, I’d have to make a trip to Hamburg, which I decided to
get out of the way. I made it back by six o’clock, looking forward to dinner, having missed lunch. As I
was heading up to my room to rinse off, the clerk called me over to inform me that my card hadn’t
passed muster after all. I not only owed them for one day, I owed them for two, having missed today’s
checkout deadline by several hours—and of course I was going to be a cash customer from now on if I
wanted to stay past tomorrow morning. I shoved nearly half my resources across the counter and told
him I’d think it over.
Yeah.
Saturday, June 8
Walkabout
So at eleven Thursday morning I joined the ranks of the homeless, my worldly goods in a plastic
bag. I stopped at a café for a croissant and coffee while I wondered what to do with myself. I thought
later I’d look for a cheap pension or maybe just a pleasant bench in the park.
I went to the site of the theater. It was uncannily tidy, smartly fenced off to a height well over two
meters. The buildings around it were perfectly unscathed. A demolition contractor could have
demanded a bonus for a job done this neatly. The top of the iron spiral staircase was sticking up out of
the rubble like the mast of a sinking schooner. The total experience wasn’t inspirational or educational
or anything. I stood there looking through the fence for about five minutes, then left.
I paid a visit to Gustl Meyer’s shop of exotic leftovers. He was polite, even sympathetic, but had no
suggestions.
I spent the afternoon at the library finding new ways to spell Michael and Dershinsky. I decided to
take my list of numbers to Gustl Meyer’s shop on the morrow to see if he’d let me use his phone.
I returned to the hotel to see if anyone had responded to my advertisement. No one had.
I lingered over a pizza and a beer till it was quite dark. Then I started walking. This time I didn’t
know where I was going except in a general way. I have a pretty good sense of direction, but if I didn’t
find what I was looking for the first time out, so what. Time was one commodity I had plenty of.
I walked and walked, on feet already sore, and the sights and smells began to come back to me. As
the social and economic atmosphere went down the scale, my spirits went up. I was heading into
Radenau’s grimiest neighborhood, the domain of factories, machine shops, brickyards, and
warehouses, inhabited at this hour only by night watchmen and guard dogs. Before long, I spotted a
small, nondescript building just ahead, a sort of shed between a warehouse and a railroad yard, and I
- 103 -
headed for it hoping the door would open, and it did, giving me a double lungful of cigarette smoke,
booze, and “La Vie en Rose.” It was Little Bohemia, and by God it felt like home.
Albrecht
I made my way to a table at the back—all the way to the back, against a wall solid with framed
drawings and prints, not one of them straight, not one of them with a piece of glass that had been
cleaned in twenty years. At eye level when I sat down was a faded sketch of Igor Stravinsky that
appeared to be signed by Picasso. Elsewhere it looked like nobody had moved since Charles and I had
left three weeks before.
When the waitress came over to see what I wanted, I asked her if her name was really Theda.
“It really is,” she said with a smile. “Are you drinking Lagavulin tonight?”
“I’m drinking your cheapest rotgut, please, Theda,” I told her politely, but when it came, a couple
minutes later, it tasted just like Lagavulin to me.
Someone spoke at my elbow and I looked up into a distantly familiar face. It was Albrecht, he of the
giant intellect, the smirking twenty-year-old Englishman who volunteered to dump me in a lake the
first time I visited the sub-sub-subbasement in the theater.
I said, “What?”
He said, sneering, “Are you B now?”
I thought about this some. I’ve never had much opportunity to learn how to deal with hostile people
—some priests do and some don’t—but I feel like I must know the ABCs of it. I said to him, “Why
don’t you sit down and tell me what’s on your mind.”
“Is the question too difficult for you?”
“Yes, it is,” I told him. With a triumph already in hand, he took a seat across from me. I said, “Why
do you ask me this question?”
“You were being groomed, weren’t you? Isn’t that the word—‘groomed’?”
“Well, there is certainly such a word, but no one ever told me I was being groomed.”
He shrugged contemptuously.
“I’ve abandoned the priesthood,” I told him. This got a blink. “When I spoke with the man who
originally sent me here, Fr. Lulfre, I told him that killing B had been a wasted effort, because B is still
here—in the person of me—but I certainly don’t think I’m ready to begin where Shirin left off. And, by
the way, I’ve deposited a tape of that conversation with a friend, otherwise I’d be a hunted man,
possibly even a dead man by now.” This got three blinks in a rapid succession. I asked him if this
answered his question—probably a mistake, since it seemed to put him back on track.
“Anyone can be hunted,” he said. “The question is, can you do what B did?”
“What exactly do you have in mind?”
“You took in their insights, but do you have any of your own? Are you a thinker and a teacher or just
a reciter of Holy Writ? If all you can do is chant the scriptures, then you’re no more B than I am.
You’re just an altar boy who has all the responses down pat.”
I downed some rotgut and wished this young whippersnapper was far, far away. Finally I said to
him, “Albrecht, the past ten days have been a bit hectic for me, so it’s absolutely true that I haven’t
added a single word to the teachings of B. Whether I can or not is another matter. Be that as it may,
you’re absolutely right. If all I can do is chant the Holy Writ as I heard it from Charles and Shirin, then
I’m no more than an altar boy.”
Albrecht smirked. “But you don’t really think you are, do you.”
“I don’t really think I am, no, but I haven’t had a chance to prove myself one way or the other.”
“Do you want a chance to prove yourself?”
What could I say to that? No?
The test
Albrecht said, “The people of our culture imagine that we invented technology, agriculture, law, and
of course civilization, but we also take credit for less praiseworthy accomplishments. Can you think of
- 104 -
some of those?”
“Well,” I said, “I suppose we take credit for things like poverty, crime, and discrimination along
racial and social lines. What Shirin called ‘the suffering classes’ are certainly our invention. Political
oppression. Mental illness.”
“You’re missing the biggest one of all, Father.”
“I’ve given up being father. Just call me Jared.”
“All right.”
“The biggest one of all would be . . . war.
“Of course. War is far and away the greatest ill we’ve brought to the world, isn’t it?”
“Yes.”
Albrecht shook his head, disgusted. “You really are pathetic, Jared. You don’t even pause to doubt, to
question what Mother Culture whispers in your ear. You remain a total captive of the Great
Forgetting.”
“Listen, let’s just skip the name-calling for a while, okay? I don’t pretend to know everything
Charles and Shirin knew—or even everything you know. You’re telling me what? That war was not our
invention?”
“That’s what I’m telling you. War is not a defect found only in our quirky, deranged culture. It’s
found wherever human culture is found—in the past and in the present. The myth of the peaceable
noble savage is exactly that, a myth.”
“Okay. So?”
Albrecht stood up. “You’re truly sad, Jared. Don’t let me hear that you’re calling yourself B in this
city. If I do, I’ll come round and embarrass you, I promise you that.”
“Sit down. Please.” He sat. “Please understand that I don’t pretend to be historically or
anthropologically knowledgeable. I will be, I hope, but right now I honestly don’t see the point you’re
making.”
“Then why don’t you ask?”
“I ask.”
“The foundation thinkers of our culture imagined that human life began when our culture began, just
a few thousand years ago. Therefore nothing could possibly be learned about human life beyond that
point. Beyond that point was nothing but a vacancy. Thus they looked into the past and saw that Man
had been born an agriculturalist and a civilization-builder. They thought this was Man’s nature and
Man’s destiny—and this is what we teach our children. The human race was born to become precisely
us. Isn’t that what we teach them?”
“Yes.”
“B has tried to show you the absurdity of this teaching by removing the obscuring lenses of the
Great Forgetting. By showing you that what came before the birth of our culture was not a vacancy. By
showing you that our culture was not born in an empty world, in a world devoid of religion and law.
Religion and law extend back hundreds of thousands of years, perhaps even millions of years, to the
very origins of human life.”
“I understand.”
“You do? You understand that religion and law extend back hundreds of thousands of years?”
“Yes.”
“Well, so does war, Jared. Explain.”
“Explain,” I repeated hopelessly.
“Is this just another sign of our vicious nature, Jared? Is that the explanation? Do we just innately
love to kill?”
“No.”
“Does that ‘no’ represent a profession of faith or a statement of fact?”
“At the moment it represents a profession of faith, but I hope to turn it into a statement of fact.”
“Fine. Do it. Take off the obscuring lenses of the Great Forgetting and explain—or for God’s sake
stop calling yourself B. Go home to your cozy little parish and apologize for behaving so foolishly.”
I felt fear. Then I realized he couldn’t possibly expect me to accomplish such a feat on the spot . . .
but he did. He said, “If you’d like to become B another time, Jared, then by all means say so. Tell me
- 105 -
this is your ambition—someday to become B. Then please go home.”
“But surely even B couldn’t perform this miracle sitting in a tavern, without a single reference book,
without even a general encyclopedia.”
“I’ll be your encyclopedia. Or if you want books on prehistoric warfare, I can have them here in half
an hour.”
“So you already know the answer to your question.”
“No, not at all. The books were not written by people who think like B. They were written by people
who in their heart of hearts believe that Man was divinely shaped to conquer and rule the world.
They’re scandalized by prehistoric warfare. They don’t explain it, they lament it. They’re embarrassed,
because the creature destined from all time to be the ruler of the world should have been finer, nobler,
more angelic. ”
“Yes, I see. . . . Am I right in assuming that prehistoric warfare was similar to the sort of warfare
found among tribal peoples in modern times?”
He shook his head, disgusted. “Either you know how to take off the obscuring lenses or you don’t,
Jared. Don’t expect me to do it for you. I’ll be on hand if you want to consult an encyclopedia, but
don’t ask me to do your thinking for you.” He got up and moved to a table by himself on the other side
of the room.
I was relieved. He was right: Either I knew how to take off the obscuring lenses or I didn’t, and it
would be easier done in solitude than in company. I flagged down Theda and ordered another drink.
The point I’d been making with Albrecht was one that I’d never explored with either Charles or
Shirin, though it was implicit in everything they said. How do we know that modern tribal peoples live
the way ancient tribal peoples lived? B’s answer is this: The tribal lifestyle survived to the present
moment because it works. What is extant in the world is what has endured, what is stable, what works.
Failed experiments disappear, successful ones are repeated and repeated and repeated. It’s fatuous to
suppose that hibernation is a recent innovation for bears—though there’s no way to prove that it isn’t;
bears hibernate because this works. It’s similarly fatuous to suppose that migration is a recent
innovation for birds—though again there’s no way to prove that it isn’t; birds migrate because this
works. It’s fatuous to suppose that web-building is a recent innovation for spiders—though there’s no
way to prove that it isn’t; spiders spin webs because this works.
If you go back in time a million years, you will not expect to find bears spinning webs, birds
hibernating, and spiders migrating. Bears hibernate today very probably because hibernation worked
for them a million years ago. Birds migrate today very probably because migration worked for them a
million years ago. And spiders spin webs today very probably because spinning webs worked for them
a million years ago. Because humans were not the object of a special creation but evolved in the bosom
of the community of life with all the rest, this sort of reasoning applies to people as well as it does to
bears, birds, and spiders. We know for a certainty that totalitarian agriculture is a recent innovation, but
there’s no reason at all to suppose that the tribal lifestyle is a recent innovation. People live tribally in
modern times very probably because living tribally worked for them a million years ago.
I asked myself what I knew about warfare in the nonhuman community. What I knew was this: The
closest thing to warfare in the nonhuman community is all within species, not between species.
Predation isn’t war. Birds aren’t at war with worms, frogs aren’t at war with mosquitoes, eagles aren’t
at war with rabbits, lions aren’t at war with antelopes. Predators don’t do battle with their prey—they
just eat them. When animals do battle, it’s always with members of their own species, for territory or
mates, and no one despises them as morally flawed or dreams of a happier day when they’ll learn to
live together like Thumper and Bambi.
When nonhuman animals battle, the winners generally take over the losers’ territory or mates. Tribal
warfare doesn’t work that way. (Albrecht confirmed this in his capacity as reference library.) Tribes
living in a given area are more or less constantly in a state of low-level war with each other, but when
Tribe X attacks Tribe Y, it doesn’t typically take over its territory or its mates; rather, after inflicting a
certain amount of damage, it typically turns around and goes home. Before long, typically, Tribe Y
returns the favor, attacking Tribe X, inflicting a certain amount of damage, then going home. This
relation of more or less permanent low-level hostility between X and Y isn’t special. The same relation
exists between X and Z and Y and Z—and these three have similarly hostile relations with the
- 106 -
neighbors around them.
Characteristically, the people of these tribes don’t think of themselves as having “a problem” with
their neighbors; characteristically, no one is “working for peace”; characteristically, no one thinks
there’s anything wrong or reprehensible about this way of life. Also characteristically, the people of
Tribe X don’t imagine that their life would be sweet if one day they went out and killed off all their
neighbors; they know there are neighbors beyond their neighbors, and these distant neighbors would be
no friendlier than their near ones. It’s in fact really not so bad. Years go by in which X doesn’t attack Y
and Y doesn’t attack X, and in these years relations between them are typically very cordial.
The task of B is to ask, “What’s working here?” or “Why is this system so successful that it’s still
around after hundreds of thousands of years?”
What’s working is that cultural identities and cultural borders are being preserved. When X attacks
Y, it doesn’t annex it. It doesn’t destroy Y’s identity or erase its borders, it just inflicts a certain amount
of damage, then turns around and goes home. It’s no different when Y attacks X. In other words, every
attack serves as a demonstration and affirmation of identity to both sides: “We’re X and you’re Y, and
here’s the border between us. We cross it at our risk, and you cross it at yours. We know you’re strong
and healthy. Every once in a while, we’re going to make sure you know we’re strong and healthy too.
We know that if we mess with you, we’ll suffer. We want you to know that if you mess with us, you’ll
suffer too.”
One would think, of course, that there must be some better system, but if thousands of centuries of
cultural experimentation haven’t turned it up, what does “better” mean? Evolution is a process that
sorts for what works, and “better” is discarded as easily as “worse”—if it doesn’t work.
What works, evidently, is cultural diversity. This should not come as a surprise. If culture is viewed
as a biological phenomenon, then we should expect to see diversity favored over uniformity. A
thousand designs—one for every locale and situation—always works better than one design for all
locales and situations. Birds are more likely to survive in ten thousand nest patterns than in one.
Mammals are more likely to survive in ten thousand social patterns than in one. And humans are more
likely to survive in ten thousand cultures than in one—as we’re in the process of proving right now.
We’re in the process of making the world unlivable for ourselves—precisely because everyone is being
forced to live a single way. There would be no problem if only one person in ten thousand lived the
way we live. The problem appears only as we approach the point where only one person in ten
thousand is permitted to live any other way than the way we live. In a world of ten thousand cultures,
one culture can be completely mad and destructive, and little harm will be done. In a world of one
culture—and that one culture completely mad and destructive—catastrophe is inevitable.
So: Tribal warfare—casual, intermittent, small-scale, and frequent—worked well for tribal peoples,
because it safeguarded cultural diversity. It was not sweet or beautiful or angelic, but it did work . . .
for hundreds of thousands of years, perhaps even millions of years.
Into the rubble
Sitting in Little Bohemia getting sloshed, I didn’t work all this out as easily or as tidily as I’ve
presented it here—and I certainly don’t suggest that this represents a definitive last word on the
subject. By taking off the obscuring lenses of the Great Forgetting, I was able to make out a dim path
where before there seemed to be only an impenetrable thicket; I haven’t explored the path to its full
extent by any means. This, I think, is what B does. B opens a path for exploration.
Albrecht was forced to agree. He wasn’t thrilled, clearly, but he had to admit that my insight into the
problem had the stamp of B on it.
When it was all over, I was pleased and surprised. How had I failed to realize that I needed to be
tested? How had I dared to think I could assume the mantle of B without first proving I could wear it?
I was pleased and surprised—and very, very drunk. I’d accepted Albrecht’s challenge around nine
o’clock, and it was now almost two. The crowd in the Little Bohemia had thinned out and, oddly, had
clustered round my table to witness Albrecht’s examination of me. I couldn’t tell whether they
comprehended what I was saying, but they listened in a lively, smiling way, applauding well-made
points, exchanging appraisals of my success, and generally cheering me on. By now, most of the
- 107 -
candles had been extinguished, and it was exceedingly dark.
Someone asked, “What is that thing?”
Quite unconsciously, I’d brought out the fossil ammonite to busy my fingers with as I made my
presentation to Albrecht. It now lay in a pool of light beside the candle on my table.
“This is another test that was given to me, one I haven’t managed to pass as yet. It’s the fossil
remains of a creature that may have lived as much as four hundred million years ago. I’ve been assured
that the past, the present, and the future are written in it. Think of it as a track in the dust. A track in the
dust shows not only where the creature has been but where it is and will be.”
“Are you supposed to tell its future?” someone asked from the shadows.
“I’m not sure. Charles Atterley gave it to me but was killed before he had a chance to explain why.
Shirin wanted me to smash it to pieces.”
“Why?”
“I don’t remember, to tell the truth.” Memory wasn’t the only thing that was beginning to slip away
from me at that point.
“There’s a message from B inside of it,” someone suggested. “Like a Chinese fortune cookie. That’s
why you have to smash it.”
“There’s no way to get a message inside,” I explained stupidly. “It’s solid rock.”
“B could get a message inside.”
Several unseen listeners expressed confident agreement with this opinion.
Before I quite realized what was going on, a fossil-smashing party had been organized. I was
uprooted from my table and hustled outdoors to stumble along in the center of a small drunken mob. I
couldn’t for the life of me figure out where we were going or why we were going anywhere at all.
Others were leading, in search of some place or resource completely unimaginable by me.
As suddenly as we began, we stopped and were promptly squashed and trampled by those who
continued to blunder forward, slapstick style. Someone ahead of me turned around, handed me a brick,
and said, “Here!”
“Bring him over here!” someone else called out. A path opened up in front of me and I was led
forward to a brick stack as wide and high as a pool table.
“Go ahead!” someone called out. “Let’s see what’s inside!”
“There’s nothing inside!” I protested.
“Here, give it to me!” another said. “I’ll do it!”
I clutched the fossil to my chest, and someone shoved me from behind. “Go on,” he said, in a voice
no longer quite friendly.
With the brick pile at my back, I turned to face them. “I’m not going to destroy this fossil”, I said.
They received this news as if it were a thunderclap. After a moment someone at the back said in a
puzzled tone, “I thought Shirin told him to smash it . . . ?”
An imposingly tall man at the front said, “Are you a coward?”
“No, I don’t think so.”
“Then why are you dithering? The fossil has no intrinsic value.”
A woman at the back called out, “He’s not a coward in general, Günter. He’s just scared of this
particular message.”
Two in the crowd spoke at once. One said, “What is the message?” The other said, “What’s he
scared of?”
The tall man called Günter stepped forward and spoke to me almost confidentially. “It’s not a thing
you can just refuse to do, Jared. Charles gave you the fossil for a reason, and Shirin said you’d have to
smash it to find out what the reason was—so you have to smash it. Otherwise this period of your life
will remain incomplete and inconclusive.”
I knew he was right, and one way or another I knew I was not going to leave that place with the
fossil intact, so with no more dithering I set it on top of the bricks and smashed it. While I stood there
befuddled, Günter stepped forward, plucked a scrap of white paper from the rubble, and instantly
balled it up in his fist.
“Give me that!” I cried.
“There’s no way to get a message inside,” he told me gravely, already walking away. “It’s solid
- 108 -
rock.”
The others laughed, and someone said, “Don’t pay any attention to him—he’s just teasing. It’s a
trick, a sleight of hand. He’s always pulling coins out of people’s ears.”
On hearing these words, Günter tossed the ball of paper over his shoulder without a break in stride,
and a woman sitting on a stack of bricks nearby darted forward to scoop it up as a souvenir. As
suddenly as it began, the show was over, and the crowd began straggling away. Only the woman who
had retrieved the scrap of paper seemed prepared to stay. I felt like crying.
“You probably don’t remember me,” she said. “I was sitting next to Shirin the first night you came
down to the cellar. Bonnie?”
“I remember you, Bonnie, I just didn’t recognize you. You look older.”
“I am older,” she assured me in all seriousness.
We stood there awkwardly through a long moment.
“Shirin didn’t hold out much hope for you,” Bonnie told me.
“Not at first anyway.”
Bonnie shrugged away my qualifying phrase. “She thought you were too fixed.”
I pondered the various meanings of that word, and evidently so did Bonnie, for she soon added a
clarification: “Too set in your ways.”
I nodded.
“Like, for example, here you are, you’ve smashed the fossil to bits, and you’re not even going to
look at it.”
I glanced at the mess on the bricks. “Bonnie, it’s just a bunch of crushed calcium carbonate.”
“Yeah, that’s what she meant. That’s just the kind of thing she’d expect you to say.”
Well, goddamn. Tonight was definitely my night to be abused and chivvied about. With an exhausted
sigh, I turned my attention to the debris beside me and sensed rather than saw Bonnie withdrawing a
bit to give me some space.
What was I supposed to be seeing here, if there was anything to be seen? Or: How was I supposed to
be looking at it? What had Shirin said about it? I didn’t think the memory was there at all, then it
suddenly leaped to mind. She said, “I want to show you how to read the future.” Then she observed
that Charles would have done it better and that the point of the exercise needed to be “more fully
developed.”
She wanted to show me how to read the future. I closed my eyes and tried to listen for what she
would say. What words would not surprise me coming from her mouth on this subject?
Suddenly I heard her say, “The universe is all of a piece, Jared.” It was so clear that I opened my
eyes, half expecting to see her standing in front of me, but only Bonnie was there, sitting on a nearby
stack of bricks and gazing up at the stars. I closed my eyes again, thinking, “So the universe is all of a
piece. What does this tell me about anything?”
I let her speak: “This tells you that the flight path of a goose over Scandinavia has something to do
with a man dying in a hospital room in New Jersey—but it takes some figuring to find out what it is.
This tells you that what’s hidden inside a fossil two hundred million years old has something to do with
Jared Osborne. This too takes some figuring. This kind of figuring is the diviner’s specialty, Jared,
though anyone can learn to do it. The diviner is just a special tracker, a tracker of events and relations.
Think about what you want right now. What are you looking for?”
That was easy. “I’m looking for you.”
“Your search begins with this fossil, Jared. You could easily have told me its future when I asked
you to, but you were too cowardly to try. Now you know its future, don’t you.”
“Yes, it’s future is dust. It had no other future from the moment Charles handed it to me. Even if I
hadn’t smashed it, it had no other future. One day, in a week or a million years, it was going to become
rubble, and no other destiny was ever possible for it.”
“The universe is all of a piece, Jared. Charles bought this fossil for you because he knew it had a
message for you—a message of some kind, he couldn’t have guessed what, at that point. Ask for that
message now, Jared. Ask this fossil what it has to do with you. What is it trying to show you?”
“I don’t know,” I said, predictably.
“Become a diviner now, Jared. You’re looking for something. Cut open a bird and examine its

Chapter 16
The Greedy Method
We now start to discuss several general tech-
niques on designing good algorithms. We will
go over the basic scenarios, in which those
techniques can be applied, and many concrete
applications. Hopefully, when a similar sce-
nario arises, such a technique will come into
minds quickly.
We begin with the optimization problems, in
which we are given a set of constraints and an
optimization function. Solutions that satisfy
the constraints are called feasible solutions.
A feasible solution for which the optimization
function has the best possible value is called
an optimal solution.

A thirsty baby
Assume there is a thirsty, but smart, baby, who
has access to a glass of water, a carton of milk,
etc., a total of n different kinds of liquids. Let
ai be the amount of ounces in which the ith
liquid is available. Based on her experience,
she also assigns certain satisfying factor, si,
to the ith liquid. If the baby needs to drink
t ounces of liquid, how much of each liquid
should she drink?
Let xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, be the amount of the ith
liquid the baby will drink. The solution for this
thirsty baby problem is obtained by finding real
numbers xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, that maximize n sixi,
i=1
subject to the constraints that n xi = t and
i=1
for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 0 ≤ xi ≤ ai.
We notice that if n ai < t, then this instance
i=1
will not be solvable.

A specification
Input: n, t, si, ai, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. n is an integer, and
the rest are positive reals.
Output: If n ai ≥ t, output is a set of real
  i=1 n
  numbers xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, such that i=1 si xi is
      maximum, n xi = t, and for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
      i=1 
      0 ≤ xi ≤ ai. 
In this case, the constraints are n
and for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 0 ≤ xi ≤ i=1 xi = t,
        optimization function is n sixi . 
        i=1 
ai, and the
Every set of xi that satisfies the constraints is
a feasible solution, and if it further maximizes
n
i=1 sixi is an optimal solution.
Question: How should the kid pick them up?

Loading problem
A large ship is to be loaded with containers of
cargos. Different containers, although of equal
size, will have different weights. Let wi be the
weight of the ith container, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and the
capacity of the ship is c, we want to find out
how could we load the ship with the maximum
number of containers.
Let xi ∈ {0, 1}. If xi = 1, we will load the ith
container, otherwise, we will not load it. We
wish to assign values to xis such that n xi ≤
i=1
c, and xi ∈ {0, 1}. The optimization function is
n
i=1 xi .
Question: Which containers should we load
into the ship?
4
The greedy method
One way to construct a solution for such op-
timization problems is the greedy method, in
which we construct the solution in stages. At
each stage we make a decision that appears
to be the best at that time, according to cer-
tain greedy criterion, and will not be changed
in later stages. Hence, each decision should
assume the feasibility.
Although the greedy method does not always
lead to an optimal solution, e.g., in the short-
est path problem as we will discuss later, it
does in some other cases.
5
Change making
A child buys a candy bar at less than one buck
and gives a $1 bill to the cashier, who wants
to make a change using the fewest number of
coins. The cashier constructs the change in
stages, in each of which a coin is added to the
change.
The greedy criterion is as follows: At each
stage, increase the total amount as much as
possible. To ensure the feasibility, such amount
in no stage should exceed the desired change.
For example, if the desired change is 67 cents.
The first two stages will add in two quarters.
The next one adds a dime, and following one
will add a nickel, and the last two will finish off
with two pennies.
6
Machine scheduling
We are given an infinite supply of machines,
and n tasks to be performed in those machines.
Each task has a start time, si, and finish time,
ti. The period [si, ti] is called the processing
interval of task i. Two tasks i and j might
overlap, e.g., [1, 4] overlaps with [2, 4], but
not with [4, 7].
A feasible assignment is an assignment in which
no machine is given two overlapped tasks. An
optimal assignment is a feasible one that uses
fewest number of machines.
We line up tasks in nondecreasing order of sis,
and call a machine old, if it has been assigned
a task, otherwise, call it new. A greedy strat-
egy could be the following: At each stage, if
an old machine becomes available by the start
time of a task, assign the task to this machine;
otherwise, assign it to a new one.
7
An example
Given seven tasks, their start time, as well as
their finish time as follow:
task a
start 0
finish 2
b c
3 4
7 7
d e
9 7
11 4
f
1
5
g

8
Then, by the aforementioned strategy, we can
assigned the tasks to machines in the following
way:
It may be implemented in Θ(n log n), by us-
ing a minHeap of availability times for the old
machines.
8
It does not always work!
Given the following digraph:
we want to find out the shortest path from v1
to v5. An intuitive way is to find it in stages.
At a certain stage, if the path built so far ends
at vertex q, we can select the nearest vertex
that is adjacent to q, but not on the path yet.
For our example, this strategy will lead to v1, v3,
v4, v2, v5 of length 10, which is certainly not the
shortest one.
9
The Knapsack problem
We want to pack a knapsack with a capacity of
c. From a list of n items, we must select items
from a list of n. Each item has both a weight of
wi and a profit of pi. In a feasible solution, the
sum of the weights must not exceed c, and an
optimal solution is both feasible and reaches
the maximum profit. This problem generalizes
the container loading one, in the sense that in
the loading problem, the profit of every object
is the same.
For example, if you win the first-prize in a gro-
cery store contest, and the prize is a free cart
of load of groceries. Your goal is to fit the cart
with the maximum value. This can certainly
be modeled as a knapsack problem. But, in
reality, there might be some other factor, e.g.,
time.
10
Strategies
As this 0/1 knapsack problem is NP-complete,
which we will get to later, we don’t expect to
find an easy solution.
One greedy criterion is to pick up the one with
the most profit. This will not always lead to an
optimal solution. For example, if n = 3, w =
[100, 10, 10], p = [20, 15, 15], and, c = 105.
Then this strategy will bring in a piece worth
20, if we just pick the one with the maximum
profit, i.e., the first one; even though we could
bring in 30 by picking up the two less profitable
pieces.
11
Another idea is to be greedy on weight, i.e.,
among the remaining objects, always pick up
the one with minimum weight. This will not
always work, either. For example, when n =
2, w = [10, 20], p = [5, 100], and c = 25.
Yet another one is to be greedy on the profit
p
density, i.e., wi . But, this one will sometimes
i
fail also. For example, when w = [20, 15, 15],
p = [40, 25, 25], and c = 30.
Homework: Read through the subsection on
the Knapsack problems in pp.382, then finish
Exercise 16.2-4(*).
12
By and large, the profit density strategy is a
pretty good one. In an experiment involved
with 600 randomly generated instances, it gen-
erated optimal solutions 239. For 583 instances,
the so generated solution had a value within
10% of the optimal, and all 600 solutions fell
within 25% of the optimal.
With k−optimal, it will fill the knapsack with a
k subset first, and then proceed by the non in-
creasing profit density. If n = 4, w = [2, 4, 6, 7],
p = [6, 10, 12, 13], and c = 11. When k = 2, we
need to consider {1, 2, }, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}
and {3, 4}. The last one can’t be used, and the
rest lead to [1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0,
1], [0, 1, 1, 0], and [0, 1, 0, 1]. The last three
solutions all lead to a profit value of 23, which
is sent out as the solution.
In O(nk+1), the profit value so obtained is guar-
100
anteed to be within k+1 of the optimal.
13
Variable-length code
In ASCII code, every character is coded in 8
bits. So, if we have a text file with 1,000
characters, we have to use 8,000 bits to store
it.
In reality, some characters are used more often
than the others (Think about Wheel of For-
tune). It makes sense to assign shorter codes
to those used more often, and longer codes to
those used less often.
The question is how? One approach is to find
out the frequencies of the letters, then assign
shorter codes to the more frequently occurring
one, and longer codes to the less frequently
occurring ones.
14
An example
In the string aaxuaxz, the frequency of a, x, u
and z are 3, 2, 1 and 1. We can then assign “0”
to ‘a’, “10” to ‘x’, “110” to ‘u’, and “111”’
to ‘z’.
Hence, aaxuaxz will be coded as 0010110010111.
The length is 13 bits, compared with 14, if we
give each of them two bits. No big deal.
On the other hand, if the file contains 1,000
letters, and the frequency of these four sym-
bols are (996, 2, 1, 1), then the 2 bits per
code method leads to 2,000 bits long, while
our code will lead to a file of only 1,006 bits,
almost a 50% save.
15
The other side...
To decode “0010110010111”, since no code
starts with “00”, “00”, gives “aa”. Similarly,
no code starts with “10”, we read off an ’x’,
etc..
In general, we always read off the longest possi-
ble piece from the remaining code string, since
this coding is a prefix code, i.e., no code is a
prefix of another one.
Question: How to generate such code for a
given text file?
Answer: Huffman tree.
16
Construct an Huffman tree
An optimal code is always represented by a full
binary tree, which is constructed as follows:
When we construct the tree, we always want
to add a node with the smallest weight, an
minHeap, Q is the following algorithm, is an
obvious choice.
Algorithm analysis
The algorithm is rather straightforward: We
initialize the priority queue with the character
set C, then, repeatedly merge two nodes with
the smallest frequencies into a new node with
its frequency being the sum of those two, until
we have only one node left, which is returned
as the resulted tree.
Line 2 takes O(n). Line 3 takes Θ(n), while
lines 5, 6 and 8 all take log n. Thus, it takes
O(n log n) to construct a Huffman tree for n
characters.

Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, and are known for their role in pollination and for producing honey and beeswax. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea, presently considered as a clade Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven to nine recognized families,[1] though many are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.

Bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae.

Bees have a long proboscis (a complex "tongue") that enables them to obtain the nectar from flowers. They have antennae almost universally made up of 13 segments in males and 12 in females, as is typical for the superfamily. Bees all have two pairs of wings, the hind pair being the smaller of the two; in a very few species, one sex or caste has relatively short wings that make flight difficult or impossible, but none are wingless.

Tiny bee stingless bee species exist whose workers are less than 2 mm (0.079 in) long.[2] The largest bee in the world is Megachile pluto, a leafcutter bee whose females can attain a length of 39 mm (1.5"). Members of the family Halictidae, or sweat bees, are the most common type of bee in the Northern Hemisphere, though they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies.

The best-known bee species is the European honey bee, which, as its name suggests, produces honey, as do a few other types of bee. Human management of this species is known as beekeeping or apiculture.

Bees are the favorite meal of Merops apiaster, the bee-eater bird. Other common predators are kingbirds, mockingbirds, beewolves, and dragonflies.

Evolution
The ancestors of bees were wasps in the family Crabronidae, and therefore predators of other insects. The switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae. This same evolutionary scenario has also occurred within the vespoid wasps, where the group known as "pollen wasps" also evolved from predatory ancestors. Up until recently, the oldest non-compression bee fossil had been Cretotrigona prisca in New Jersey amber and of Cretaceous age, a meliponine. A recently reported bee fossil, of the genus Melittosphex, is considered "an extinct lineage of pollen-collecting Apoidea sister to the modern bees", and dates from the early Cretaceous (~100 mya).[3] Derived features of its morphology ("apomorphies") place it clearly within the bees, but it retains two unmodified ancestral traits ("plesiomorphies") of the legs (two mid-tibial spurs, and a slender hind basitarsus), indicative of its transitional status.

The earliest animal-pollinated flowers were pollinated by insects such as beetles, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established before bees first appeared. The novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are generally more efficient at the task than any other pollinating insect such as beetles, flies, butterflies and pollen wasps. The appearance of such floral specialists is believed to have driven the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms, and, in turn, the bees themselves.

Among living bee groups, the "short-tongued" bee family Colletidae has traditionally been considered the most "primitive", and sister taxon to the remainder of the bees. In the 21st century, however, some researchers have claimed that the Dasypodaidae is the basal group, the short, wasp-like mouthparts of colletids being the result of convergent evolution, rather than indicative of a plesiomorphic condition.[1] This subject is still under debate, and the phylogenetic relationships among bee families are poorly understood.

Eusocial and semisocial bees

A honey bee swarm

Honey bees defend against wasp attacks
Bees may be solitary or may live in various types of communities. The most advanced of these are eusocial colonies[4] found among the honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees. Sociality, of several different types, is believed to have evolved separately many times within the bees.

In some species, groups of cohabiting females may be sisters, and if there is a division of labor within the group, then they are considered semisocial.

If, in addition to a division of labor, the group consists of a mother and her daughters, then the group is called eusocial. The mother is considered the queen and the daughters are workers. These castes may be purely behavioral alternatives, in which case the system is considered "primitively eusocial" (similar to many paper wasps), and if the castes are morphologically discrete, then the system is "highly eusocial".

There are many more species of primitively eusocial bees than highly eusocial bees, but they have rarely been studied. The biology of most such species is almost completely unknown. The vast majority are in the family Halictidae, or "sweat bees". Colonies are typically small, with a dozen or fewer workers, on average. The only physical difference between queens and workers is average size, if they differ at all. Most species have a single season colony cycle, even in the tropics, and only mated females (future queens, or "gynes") hibernate (called diapause). A few species have long active seasons and attain colony sizes in the hundreds. The orchid bees include a number of primitively eusocial species with similar biology. Certain species of allodapine bees (relatives of carpenter bees) also have primitively eusocial colonies, with unusual levels of interaction between the adult bees and the developing brood. This is "progressive provisioning"; a larva's food is supplied gradually as it develops. This system is also seen in honey bees and some bumblebees.

Highly eusocial bees live in colonies. Each colony has a single queen, many workers and, at certain stages in the colony cycle, drones. When humans provide the nest, it is called a hive. Honey bee hives can contain up to 40,000 bees at their annual peak, which occurs in the spring, but usually have fewer.
